However, these capabilities have yet to be fully explored in public practice. In this paper we ﬁrst discuss a general framework for performing transportation equity analysis using activity-based travel demand models, distributional comparisons, and incorporating equity standards. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of distributional comparisons, relative to average measures. This demonstration uses the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and (activity-based) mode choice model. The ﬁndings show that distributional comparisons are capable of clearly revealing the winners and losers that result from transportation improvements, in comparison with average measures. The use of these results will likely result in diﬀerent conclusions on transportation investments.},

This mix makes the management of safety in traffic analysis zones (TAZs) explicitly challenging. This study investigated the association between crash frequencies and various types of trip productions and attractions in combination with the road characteristics of 1,349 TAZs of four counties in the state of Florida. Crash safety management of these TAZs is emphasized through prioritizing them by examining the effects of trip and roadway factors on the aggregated crash frequencies. Models were developed separately for total crashes, severe crashes (fatal and severe injury crashes), total crashes during peak hours, and pedestrian- and bicycle-related crashes on the basis of various groups of estimators. It was found that the total crash model and the peak-hour crash model were best estimated by total trip productions and total trip attractions. The severe crash model was best fit by trip-related variables only, and the pedestrian- and bicycle-related crash model was best fit by road-related variables only. The results from this study pave the way for better safety management and the incorporation of safety measures in travel and network planning.},

The capacities are allocated such that the total time spent by all pedestrians is minimized. The framework assumes informed pedestrians where each pedestrian is minimizing the combined access and service times at the facility. The framework is first illustrated using a hypothetical area with few service facilities. Then, the results are presented for the application of the framework to plan the amenity services in a major pilgrimage site in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. The results illustrate the capabilities of the framework in determining the optimal service area for each facility, which is essential for the design of wayfinding schemes that ensure service efficiency. Furthermore, it provides a plan for prioritizing capacity expansion of the facilities such that pedestrians' benefits are maximized.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Insufficient physical activity (PA) is a key contributor for premature mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite the well-documented health benefits of PA, few women achieve the recommended levels of PA. The global average of inactivity among women is higher at 31.7\% compared to 23.4\% for inactive men. The gender gap in PA participation is wider in India where estimates indicate that 44\% women are insufficiently active, compared to 25\% men.Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of Chennai, India. Participants (N = 370) were recruited from 155 wards stratified by neighborhood walkability and socio-economic status. The adapted Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale for India (NEWS-India) was used to assess built environment perceptions on density, land-use mix, street infrastructure, aesthetics, traffic and crime safety. Travel and leisure PA were recorded using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form (IPAQ-LF). Study protocols were based on recommendations of the International Physical activity and the Environment Network (IPEN; www.ipenproject.org) and previously used in studies in Brazil, Colombia, and Nigeria.Results: A greater number of women reported achieving weekly PA levels from travel-related activities (n = 54, 16.0\%) compared to men (n = 33, 9.8\%). In contrast, a higher percentage of men (n = 75, 22.3\%) met weekly PA recommendations during leisure-time compared to women (n = 54, 16.1\%). Street connectivity (aOR = 3.2, CI = 1.3, 8.0) and land-use mix access (aOR = 3.7, CI = 1.4, 8.2) significantly increased odds of travel PA among women.Conclusions: Low engagement in leisure PA among women can be linked to prevailing sociocultural norms that constrain women's mobility and hinder their participation in PA. Aspects of gender equity in transportation planning are closely linked with citywide indicators of liveability, sustainability and resilience in LMICs like India. Public health practitioners must address gender-specific barriers to increase PA among women through context-specific group exercise programs, peer support and guidance that emphasize the importance of PA.},

To address these issues, numerous studies propose and apply "justice tests", which relate the effects of transport policies to prevailing socioeconomic deprivation. While the theoretical foundations of justice tests are well-established, there exists less agreement on methodological aspects and empirical specifications. In this paper, we propose a new criterion for evaluating the results of justice tests namely the correlation coefficient and explore its sensitivity to empirical assumptions by way of a case study of a major public transport investment. In comparison to other criteria identified in the literature, our proposed criterion appears to generate relatively stable results while being simple to calculate, interpret, and communicate.}

This paper deals with the elderly's specific needs in the public open space as it can play a significant role in their social inclusion and could be especially relevant in deprived areas. The main goal is to build a model to evaluate the vulnerability of the public space by focusing on the elderly's needs, using indicators. A previous analysis of the scientific and policy-oriented literature and of the technical standards and regulations linked with accessibility and social aspects that affect the elderly in urban areas was performed to identify the main dimensions for evaluation. The interjudge agreement technique was applied to validate the indicators with a panel of experts in technical and social disciplines. The model was applied to a vulnerable area in Castellon (East Spain), based on indicators adapted to the specific context features. The agreement level reached by experts was used to weight the indicators. The application of the model permitted the vulnerability in the suggested dimensions to be estimated and a global integrated index of vulnerability in the area to be calculated. It could assist in urban planning decision making toward age-friendly and, therefore, inclusive cities.},

Since decisions on the location of bus terminals in large agglomerations determine transportation costs and the quality of service of public transport passengers, the use of multicriteria analysis becomes necessary. In that respect, the intercity bus terminals proposed by 2023 Long-Range Landuse Plan (LRLUP) and 2023 Transportation Master Plan (TMP) of Istanbul are examined based on decision criteria of accessibility and suitability within the environment they are located. The multi-criteria analysis was performed using the additive value (AV) model to evaluate the locations of existing and planned intercity bus terminals in Istanbul based on their specific location characteristics defined. Criteria used in the analysis are the location within the region, population coverage and density, land value, accessibility by highway and public transit modes, availability of land for capacity expansion, and the surrounding land-use and geological characteristics. Based on the design criteria assessed, a general score for the location of each intercity bus-terminal (two existing and nine planned) was calculated using normalized importance weights obtained from an expert survey, and then the terminals were ranked based on their scores calculated for the base (2010 and before) and plan years (2023), respectively. Based on their total score, they were ranked and grouped into three categories as follows: (1) scores higher than 0.75, (2) between 0.51 and 0.75, and (3) equal to or smaller than 0.50. All planned terminals scored equal or higher than 0.50 (two out of nine are in the first category, six are in the second category, and one is in the third category), and this proved that all of them were planned where they were needed. Then, an availability analysis was carried out to identify the configurations of the bus terminals depending on each other, which is deemed to yield their best configuration. The results of this paper will be of relevance to urban and transportation planners facing a decision to make and prioritize transport planning decisions concerning the spatial planning of a metropolitan city based on chosen decision criteria.}

This paper analyses the ways in which public transport mobility plays a role in the livelihood strategies of women living in a resettlement area at the fringe of Chennai, India. The main question addressed is how women exercise agency in embedding spatial practices within their livelihood strategies to reconnect to the city.The analysis is based on 4 months fieldwork in Semmencherry Resettlement Area in Chennai (India). It combines a qualitative analysis with a spatial exploration drawing on concepts from debates on the livelihoods approach, spatial practices, and accessibility and transport-related exclusion. Results show that the more agency women have to negotiate livelihoods strategies, the better they can take complex decisions on accessing resources over large distances and minimizing their adverse effects.We argue that combining a livelihood with a spatial analysis is important because it shows how spatial exclusion has to be assessed according to women's own priorities and decisions concerning spatial practices as part of livelihoods strategies. Accessibility and recreating relational spaces may both widen women's opportunities as well as overstretch their physical and financial resources. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {BackgroundCreating liveable' cities has become a priority for various sectors, including those tasked with improving population health and reducing inequities. Two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities by 2050, with the most rapid urbanisation in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, there is limited guidance about what constitutes a liveable city from a LMIC perspective, with most of the evidence relating to high-income countries, such as Australia. Existing liveability frameworks include features such as public transport, affordable housing, and public open space; however, these frameworks may not capture all of the liveability considerations for cities in LMIC contexts.ObjectivesThis case study formed a multi-sectoral partnership between academics, policymakers (Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, Victorian (Australia) Department of Health and Human Services), and a non-government organisation (UN Global Compact - Cities Programme). This study aimed to: 1) conceptualise and prioritise components of urban liveability within the Bangkok, Thailand context; 2) identify alignment to or divergence from other existing liveability tools; and 3) identify potential indicators and data sources for use within a Pilot Bangkok Liveability Framework.MethodsThe Urban Liveability Workshop involving technical leaders from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration and a rapid review of liveability literature informed the conceptualisation of liveability for Bangkok. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Working Group and key informants in Bangkok provided input into the liveability framework. Indicators identified for Bangkok were mapped onto existing liveability tools, including the UN Global Compact CityScan.ResultsFindings revealed commonalities with the Australian liveability definition, as well as new potential indicators for Bangkok. The resulting Pilot Bangkok Liveability Framework provides a structure for measuring liveability in Bangkok that can be implemented by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration immediately, pending appropriate data acquisition and licensing. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Working Group and key informants identified core issues for implementation, including limited spatial data available at the district-level or lower.ConclusionsThis study conceptualised urban liveability for Bangkok, a city in a LMIC context, with potential for adjustment to other cities. Future work should leverage opportunities for using open source data, building local capacity in spatial data expertise, and knowledge sharing between cities.}

  abstract = {In this article we examine equity in new active travel infrastructure in London, UK. We focus on Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) introduced during Covid-19. These area-based schemes mainly involve 'modal filters' that restrict through motor traffic from residential streets within a neighbourhood. Such approaches to traffic management are traditional in the Netherlands, but are relatively novel in London and other global cities such as Barcelona. LTNs are often controversial, with one criticism being that they are implemented in affluent areas and hence benefit richer residents. London represents an excellent opportunity to investigate whether these rapidly introduced schemes have so far been equitably distributed. We focused on LTNs introduced between March and September 2020 and still present at the end of October 2020. Having generated datasets representing these new LTN locations and their boundary roads, we matched these to Output Areas (OAs, administrative areas containing around 300 residents). We then examined the extent to which LTN implementation was associated with age, ethnicity, disability, employment and car ownership (using Census 2011 data) and small-area deprivation (using the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2019). We estimated that 3.7\% of all Londoners live inside a new LTN, and 8.9\% live within 500 m walking distance of a new modal filter. Across London as a whole, people in the most deprived quarter of OAs were 2.5 times more likely to live in a new LTN, compared to Londoners in the least deprived quarter. While overall Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) people were slightly more likely than White Londoners to live in a new LTN, this varied by ethnic group. Specifically, Black Londoners were somewhat more likely, and Asian Londoners somewhat less likely than White people to live in a new LTN. Car-free households were more likely to live in a new LTN. We also examined equity within London's districts, which lead on implementation of LTNs. In the median district, people in more deprived areas were more likely to live in an LTN than people in less deprived areas, suggesting that, on average, individual districts have prioritised their more deprived areas. However, in the median district, BAME residents were slightly less likely to live in an LTN than White residents. Across districts implementing LTNs there was wide variation, with some much more or less equitable than others. A third of districts implemented no LTNs at all. Finally, at the micro level, residents living in LTNs were demographically similar to neighbours living in OAs that touched an LTN boundary road. We conclude that LTN implementation has been broadly equitable at the city and micro levels, but the picture is more mixed at the district level, despite districts being encouraged to consider deprivation when planning LTN locations. Equity metrics should be used in policy and research to monitor and improve the distribution of active travel interventions.}

  abstract = {Urban governments show great interest in formulating policies for the sustainable transport sector. Many tend to integrate environmental, economic, and social impacts into transport decision-making, and develop a system capable of achieving all transport objectives which are: accessibility, safety, affordability, and environmentally friendly. The purpose of this study is to measure the sustainability of Amman transportation system based on United States environmental protection agency guidelines, using four performance measures: transit accessibility, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita, carbon intensity, and transit productivity. Wadi Al-sair and Al Abdali Districts were selected to represent Amman. Accessibility was evaluated using GIS software; estimation of VMT per capita, carbon intensity, and transit productivity were mainly based on data obtained from field survey. The results reveal that accessibility is good in the study area, while VMT per capita was found to be lower than in the United States, carbon intensity was higher than the world average, while transit productivity was higher than in developed countries. The study concluded that the system needs improvement in all measured areas to go towards sustainability, in addition to a significant reliance on private transit at the expense of public transport. Public transport must be improved to encourage people to move towards it. As well as the adoption of intelligent land-use growth, such as comprehensive urban and regional planning, including compact cities, mixed land use, and transit oriented development.}

This paper provides a framework and an empirical investigation in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA) examining the links between public transit accessibility and the risks of social exclusion, simply understood as the suppressed ability to conduct daily activities at normal levels. Specifically, we use a large-sample travel survey to present a new transport-geography concept termed participation deserts, neighbourhood-level clusters of lower than expected activity participation. We then use multivariate models to estimate where, and for whom, improvements in transit accessibility will effectively increase activity participation and reduce risks of transport-related social exclusion. Our results show that neighbourhoods with high concentrations of low-income and zero-car households located outside of major transit corridors are the most sensitive to having improvements in accessibility increase daily activity participation rates. We contend that transit investments providing better connections to these neighbourhoods would have the greatest benefit in terms of alleviating existing inequalities and reducing the risks of social exclusion. The ability for transport investments to liberate suppressed activity participation is not currently being predicted or valued in existing transport evaluation methodologies, but there is great potential in doing so in order to capture the social equity benefits associated with increasing transit accessibility.},

In this article, we develop a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modeling and accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation networks and travel behavior, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the number of opportunities. We use this method to compute access to employment for Canada's eight largest cities to comparatively examine inequalities in accessibility, both within and between cities, and by travel mode.},

  abstract = {Millions of Canadians rely on public transportation to conduct daily activities and participate in the labour force. However, many low-income households are disadvantaged because existing public transit service does not provide them with sufficient access to destinations. Limited transit options, compounded with socioeconomic disadvantage, can result in transport poverty, preventing travel to important destinations, like employment opportunities. Given the growing gentrification of Canadian downtowns and the dispersion of poverty into Canadian suburbs, the time is right for a national accounting of those living in transport poverty, and the development of a national transport and land use strategy for alleviating the risks of accessibility deprivation. Accordingly, in this paper we measure and analyze vertical inequalities in access to employment in Canadian cities in order to estimate how many, where, and to what extent, Canadians are at risk of transport poverty. We make use of open transit network data and cutting edge accessibility measurement methods to generate comparative scores suitable for a national-scale analysis. We find that in aggregate, lower income neighbourhoods tend to have better levels of transit accessibility. But despite this overall positive outlook, there are still nearly one million low-income individuals living in urban areas with low transit accessibility. We summarize our findings by generating descriptive typologies for areas vulnerable to transport poverty which are then used to develop and recommend planning strategies to reduce inequalities.},

A composite index to assessing accessibility of public transit is described. It involves use of readily-available methods and represents a more holistic measure of transit accessibility, integrating developer, planner, and operator perspectives. The paper reviews previous and current methods of measuring accessibility and selects three methods for application in a case study in Meriden, Connecticut. Inconsistencies are noted across the methods, and a consistent grading scale is presented to standardize scores. Finally, this paper proposes weighting factors for individual methods to formulate a composite measure based on individual accessibility component measures. The approach aims to provide a robust and uniformly applicable measure that can be interpreted easily by planners to identify shortcomings in service coverage and promote equity in transit accessibility in the community.}

This study detailed an indexing model for accessibility of transit need and focused on the necessity of evaluating transit needs and transit accessibility simultaneously. A need index was developed to identify areas in high need of public transit services from economic and sociodemographic information, and a composite accessibility index was developed to identify levels of access to transit services and shortcomings in providing service. The need for transit service was then modeled as the lack of transit accessibility, and the model correlated different access indicators with their ability to predict transit service need. This model mapped areas with different levels of transit accessibility and transit needs by using a single score, which may be easily interpreted by planners who examine transit equity. The model was applied to the city of Meriden, Connecticut, and results were compared with a general approach for consistency and effectiveness. The usefulness of the model was also highlighted through a representative example of the model's application.}

  abstract = {According to the Higher Council for the Rights of persons with disabilities (HCD) disabled people constitute 13\% of the Jordanian community, 41\% of them are female (Thompson, 2018 [1]; HCD Statistical Report, 2015). 11.2\% of Jordan's population aged 5 years and older had a disability, 84\% of them are living in urban areas and are still facing obstacles to accessibility and inclusiveness through urban environments (Thompson, 2018). Planners and policy makers are responsible for ensuring access for people with disabilities through careful planning taking into account the allocation and accessibility of relevant services. It is therefore necessary for them to monitor the accessibility of disabled people to the primary public services needed by disabled individuals. This research methodology integrates Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques with Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) techniques to model the accessibility of disabled people to relevant services in Greater Irbid Municipality Area (GIMA). The resulting map shows the street network classified into four classes of accessibility. It concludes the current situation of accessibility of the disabled people to relevant services and indicates parts of the public urban space. These parts are more likely to be attended by the disabled and provide them better opportunity to mobile and live independently. The lack of a deliberate provision of service has a negative impact on the overall level of accessibility of services for disabled people and makes these services inaccessible to the disabled inhabitants of outlying suburbs. This research provides insight into accessibility of the disabled to relevant services that can benefit in decision support for improving accessibility and locating services and facilities. It also provides a benchmark for developing policies, regulations and a framework for future planning that despite the strong legislative base, there is alack for implementation, supervision and monitoring (Thompson, 2018). The process of accessing services provided within public urban space by the disabled encounter many obstacles and barriers that the society often plans and develops without considering the needs of the disabled. Due to inadequate planning, the disabled are marginalized and imprisoned in their houses, what negatively affects their full participation to urban and social life (HCD, 2015 [3]; Thompson, 2018).Furthermore it provides a methodology that can be used for monitoring accessibility for the disabled in such areas towards achieving sustainable urban development.

Exploring transit deserts may help transit agencies improve accessibility to services while improving transit distribution and equity. This study utilizes the concepts of transit demand and transit supply to identify transit deserts in the City of Dallas. The comprehensive public transit accessibility (CPTA) score is introduced to evaluate accessibility to transit and to provide a holistic view of transit supply. While previous studies have primarily used proximity or spatial indicators to describe accessibility, this study utilizes a comprehensive set of spatial and temporal measures (connectivity to the network, connectivity to destinations, service frequency, flexibility, and time efficiency) to estimate accessibility to transit. Overlapping areas of high demand (transit dependency) and low supply (as measured using the CPTA) are then characterized as transit deserts. The CPTA score and its application to the analysis of transit deserts provides a universal framework which can be broadly applied by transit agencies, city officials, and transit stakeholders. The contributions of this study are as follows: first, developing a comprehensive framework to estimate transit supply or accessibility; and second, introducing a methodology for identifying transit deserts.}

Methods An ecological study employing generalized linear regression models of access to PCPs and mortality rates in 4,761 block groups in Washington State in 2015. To measure access to PCPs, we used a 2-step floating catchment area approach, taking into account area-level population, supply of PCPs, and travel time between PCPs, as well as area-level population with a distance decay function. Results A 1-unit increase in PCP access score was associated with a reduction of 4.2 all-cause deaths per 100,000 people controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. A 1-unit increase in PCP access score was associated with a reduction of 2.7 cancer deaths and a reduction of 2.1 heart disease deaths per 100,000 people controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. Conclusions Better access to PCPs was associated with lower mortality from all-causes, cancers, and heart disease. The 2-step floating catchment area approach can help with the identification of PCP shortage areas, the development of rural residency programs, and the expansion of the physician workforce in Washington State and other regions.},

This lateral clearance distance has never been measured for cyclists transporting a child. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate the behaviour of motorized vehicles in overtaking cyclists with and without a child on the same bicycle.Methods: The lateral clearance distance of the overtaking manoeuvres of motorized vehicles was measured using an instrumented bicycle when performing 19 cycling trips on one single road with two different types of cycling infrastructure (a bike lane and shared lane mark ing) in the Brussels Capital Region (Belgium). Mixed effect regression was used to examine the effect of cycling condition (cyclist without a child [control], cyclist with a child bike seat and cyclist with a child bike trailer) and secondary independent variables (i.e. cycling infrastructure, peak traffic hours and traffic density) on the lateral clearance distance.Results: The mean lateral clearance distance in 'cyclists without child' was significantly smaller (117.3 cm) than in 'cyclists with child' (128.8 cm) (95\%CI [7.2;15.9]). Looking at 'morning peak traffic hours' (i.e. 7:00 to 9:00 a.m.) a cyclist with child bike seat was over-taken at greater lateral clearance distances than a cyclist with a child bike trailer or a cyclist without child (p=0.041). Furthermore, the percentage of passing manoeuvres under 100 cm was significantly higher in 'cyclist without child' (35.3\%) in comparison to 'cyclist with child bike seat' (21.8\%) and 'cyclist with child bike trailer' (21.8\%) (Chi2=29.19, p{$<$}0.001). No significant differences were found between a shared lane marking and bike lane.Conclusion: Drivers of motorized vehicles do adapt their overtaking manoeuvre when they overtake cyclists transporting a child, keeping greater and therefore safer lateral clearance distances. In morning peak traffic hours and/or crowded circumstances the child bike seat can be considered as the safest way to transport a child in terms of lateral clearance distance. In general, with 25.3\% overtaking manoeuvres under 100cm, police should monitor compliance with the traffic rules with regard to cyclists, and motorists should be more aware of the overtaking traffic rules.

Delhi, in particular, has the notorious reputation of being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Cyclists constitute a particularly exposed population, since they cycle among motor vehicles without any protection. This paper modeled the cyclists' exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and noise in Delhi, India. Methods Using primary data collected on 1,229 kms of roads in Delhi, Generalized Additive Mixed Models with Auto-Regressive terms (GAMMAR) are constructed for noise exposure, NO2 exposure and NO2 inhalation doses. Results Results show that cyclists are exposed to 47 mu g/m(3) of NO2 and 3.3 dB(A) more when cycling on a primary road than on a residential street. Using WHO guideline values for noise and air pollution, we assessed how many minutes of inhaling doses and noise doses become potentially harmful to cyclists' health in Delhi. Such thresholds are quickly exceeded: after cycling one hour in an area with moderate predicted values of noise and air pollution, the noise dose and inhaled dose of NO2 will reach 212\% and 403 mu g on residential streets, and 459\% and 482 mu g on primary roads, respectively. Conclusion Policy makers should take these results into account to minimize cyclists' exposure, especially for the most deprived people.}

Although livability has been identified as an important outcome of this approach as well, little guidance exists on what livability actually is, how to measure it, or how transportation and land use integration strategies can promote it. The findings of a multiyear study of the livability literature, theory, and practice are followed by an extensive quantitative and qualitative study of more than 350 transit corridors including thousands of stations throughout the United States. Although often dismissed as subjective, this research shows that livability can be understood in welldefined and measurable ways, which are validated through an innovative geospatial approach using detailed national data on travel, health, safety, and other quality-of-life outcomes. The findings in this paper show how more integrated and livable transit corridors can yield multiple benefits regarding travel, health, welfare, and sustainability. The findings show how livability goals and their measures can inform planning decisions to promote equitable access to opportunities locally and regionally and yield multiple benefits. Therefore, livability can be seen as an organizing principle for determining when and how to deploy integrated transportation and land use planning strategies. A practical handbook and a calculator for building livable transit corridors are introduced; both were designed to empower practitioners and members of the public to equitably achieve higher levels of livability at local and regional scales.}

However, critical user experience issues such as crowding discomfort and travel time unreliability are still not considered in those accessibility indicators. This paper aims to apply a methodology to build spatiotemporal crowding data and estimate travel time variability in a congested public transport network to improve accessibility calculations. It relies on using multiple big data sources available in most transit systems such as smart card and automatic vehicle location (AVL) data. Sao Paulo, Brazil, is used as a case study to show the impact of crowding and travel time variability on accessibility to jobs. Our results evidence a population-weighted average reduction of 56.8\% in accessibility to jobs in a regular workday morning peak due to crowding discomfort, as well as reductions of 6.2\% due to travel time unreliability and 59.2\% when both are combined. The findings of this study can be of invaluable help to public transport planners and policymakers, as they show the importance of including both aspects in accessibility indicators for better decision making. Despite some limitations due to data quality and consistency throughout the study period, the proposed approach offers a new way to leverage big data in public transport to enhance policy decisions.}

  abstract = {As a transport mode available to everyone and most abled-bodied urban residents, walking is, actually, the most equitable mode of transport. Walking brings several benefits to inhabitants among money savings and health improvement. Unfortunately, despite its benefits, walking is not a priority in the urban planning agenda of some cities, especially in the Global South. Walkability conditions in some areas of these cities are not particularly friendly for pedestrians, which discourage walking trips and promotes inequities across inhabitants. Evidence supporting inequalities in the provision of adequate conditions for the use of active transport in the Global South cities remain scarce. This paper aims to contribute to filling this gap by first proposing a framework to link pedestrian accessibility with walkability measures. Specifically, we use a macro-scale measure of pedestrian accessibility and a meso-scale measure of walkability to compare walking conditions on different zones in Barranquilla and Soledad, Colombia. After comparing both measures, we found that low-income zones have higher walkability indexes but present lower potential pedestrian accessibility. In contrast, the highest potential pedestrian accessibilities were located in high and medium-income zones, where people rely more on private transport modes. This imbalance regarding supply and demand conditions for walking trips suggest that unfortunately, zones with the highest potential of being walkable are the ones that face more barriers to walk. Then, adequate planning policies when implemented in the right locations could promote higher use of walking and have the potential to reduce current inequalities in pedestrian infrastructure provision.},

Although there is a vast literature on accessibility, less attention is paid to accessibility as a relative concept, i.e., its relationship with the socio-economic characteristic of the population. While accessibility is known to vary by location, it also changes as a consequence of differences in individual willingness to reach destinations by certain transport modes. Using the city of Zaragoza, Spain as a case study, this paper evaluates relative non-motorized accessibility (walking and cycling) to three types of retail activities: daily, weekly, and incidental. First, a clustering process is used to identify four population groups according to their socio-economic characteristics (the young employed; the young unemployed; seniors and adults). Second, distance-decay functions based on time-willingness to reach retail destinations by non-motorized modes are compared between the four clusters of population. Third, relative accessibility maps based on gravity-based models are elaborated, highlighting places that exhibit statistical differences between the population clusters. The results indicate that willingness to reach retail stores on foot by seniors ({$>$}65 years old) was significantly different from the rest of groups analyzed, providing additional insights on how relative accessibility measurements can anticipate potential social exclusion risks.}

This paper contributes to addressing these shortcomings by using Retail Mobility Environments as an analytical and geographical concept to identify advantageous and disadvantageous non-motorised accessibility to retail for different population groups. The city of Zaragoza, Spain provides the spatial laboratory for experimentation, and the study focuses on four target groups: the young employed, the young unemployed, seniors, and adults. The results reveal social and spatial inequalities in the distribution of non-motorised accessibility in Zaragoza, with marked negative effects on the young unemployed and adults. On the other hand, seniors and the young employed are the groups that benefit from the current setup. It is finally discussed on the capacity of the proposed methodology for exploring both social and spatial inequalities, for establishing minimum accessibility requirements, and for identifying accessibility thresholds according to different population groups. Furthermore, the convenience of linking equity issues to non-motorised accessibility is also highlighted.}

  abstract = {Malta is a small island state in the Mediterranean, with one of the highest population densities and per capita car ownership rates in the European Union. University campuses located in urban areas have a substantial role to play in transport planning and policies since they are amongst the largest generators and attractors of commuters. However, at the University of Malta, mobility to and from the work and study place is still characterised by high levels of private car use, resulting in traffic congestion, parking constraint and land use uptake. The current transport system is discriminatory towards those outside the car, who cannot or do not want to drive. These people find themselves struggling for space to walk and cycle, whilst bus users have to withstand long journey times due to car traffic and limited priority. A participatory Active Travel workshop was organised at the university in order to better understand the determinants of pedestrian and cyclist mobility to and from the university campus. Participants included people from the university community as well as other interested stakeholders. Four different guided walks or cycles led participants along predefined paths in the surroundings of the university, to assess the environment from the perspective of a pedestrian or cyclist. Information on the active travelers’ experiences allows the assessment and spatial distribution of perceived walkability and bikeability around campus. These outputs are then presented in a participatory web map that has evident potential to assist in the design and improvement of public space for promoting active travel. Contributions from the workshop are used to identify barriers and opportunities for walking and cycling and to construct tangible policy recommendations for promoting active travel in the vicinity of the university and the wider urban environment in Malta.},

Participants were linked to their bikeshare trips in order to objectively assess program use.Results: Survey participants were 41\% non-White; 33\% lower-socio-economic status (`disadvantaged'); main transportation mode was split between motor vehicle, public transit, and walking; 43\% had never been on a personal bicycle in the city; and only 6\% primarily traveled via bicycle. After excluding walking, 45\% were insufficiently active (lower levels of moderate or vigorous PA based on minimum guidelines). Relative to others, those who were insufficiently active were disproportionately older, female, non-Hispanic Black and disadvantaged. Adjusted baseline results found much higher prevalence of insufficient activity among disadvantaged persons and persons primarily traveling via public transit or motor vehicle (relative to walking or cycling).Conclusions: The evaluation successfully enrolled a diverse cohort of new bikeshare members. The two-year evaluation will assess changes in biking and total activity levels, focusing on disadvantaged persons and those with insufficient activity at baseline.}

  abstract = {The objective of this paper was to assess the link between premature mortality and a combination of neighbourhood contextual (environmental and health) and compositional (socioeconomic and demographic) characteristics. We statistically and spatially examined six environmental variables (ultrafine particles, carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic pollutants, pollution released to air, tree cover, and walkability index), six health service indicators (number health providers, breast, colorectal and cervical cancer screening uptake rates, student nutrition program uptake rates, and healthy food index), and eight socioeconomic indicators (total income, Gini coefficient, two age categories-below and above 40 years, proportion of females to males, visible minorities, Indigenous peoples, education, less than grade 9) among 140 neighbourhoods of the City of Toronto in Ontario (Canada). We applied principal component analysis to identify patterns and to reduce the number of explanatory variables into combined component axes that represent unique variation in these confounded and overlapping factors. We then applied regression analysis to model the relationship between the indices of enviro-health and socioeconomics and their potential relationship with premature mortality. Residual spatial analysis was used to investigate any remaining spatial structure (such as neighbourhoods with higher residual premature mortality rates). Neighbourhood Equity Index was correlated with our enviro-health and socioeconomic indices. Premature mortality within neighbourhoods was predicted by poor cancer screenings, pollution, lack of tree canopy, increased uptake of student nutrition programs and high walkability index. A negative association between premature mortality and pollution was associated low walkability index and presence of visible minorities within neighbourhoods. There was some unexplained residual spatial variation in our model of premature mortality-especially along the shores of Lake Ontario and in neighbourhoods with major highways or road corridors: premature mortality in Toronto neighbourhoods was higher than expected along highway-corridor neighbourhoods and shorelines. Our analysis revealed a significant relationship between neighbourhood contextual features-both environmental and health-and premature mortality, suggesting that these contextual components of neighbourhoods can predict rates of urban premature mortality in Toronto.}

Those with SMI have poor cardiovascular disease behavioral risk profiles, including low physical activity engagement. This study examined the feasibility of providing city bike-share access to individuals with SMI. Methods: Participants were outpatients with SMI in a psychiatric rehabilitation program and were provided with a complimentary bikeshare program membership (Nice Ride). Demographic and clinical variables were extracted from medical records. Lab values, body mass index, 10-year cardiovascular disease risk score, and tobacco use were collected at intake. Nice Ride provided ride frequency and duration data. Results: Of 22 SMI patients enrolled, 72.7\% completed {$>$}= 1 ride. Among users, median ride length was 9 minutes (interquartile range = 49.5) and 56.3\% averaged {$>$}= 10 minutes of riding per week. Individuals living {$<$} 0.5 miles from a station were more likely to be users. Riding {$>$}= 10 minutes per week was associated with lower body mass index and male gender. Conclusion: Further work is warranted to determine if bike-share programs offer a feasible, scalable, and cost-effective method for increasing physical activity in those with SMI. These findings are currently being used for program adaptation to increase uptake.},

This paper aims to provide evidence on the associations between employment and health, and the potential pathways, as well as identifying spatial indicators that can be used to measure urban employment, a construct of liveability. We used 2011 census data to create and test two area-level spatial measures of urban employment with geo-coded population health behaviour and outcome data (2011 VicHealth survey) in 5206 employed adults living in urban Victoria, Australia. Those living in areas with higher levels of local employment had reduced odds of a longer commute (OR 0.87). The odds of a longer commute time was also greater for those who lived in an area where more people commuted to work by private vehicle (OR 1.20), and less for those who lived in local areas where more people travelled to work by public transport (OR 0.85) or active travel (OR 0.80). The odds of reporting longer sitting times was less for those who lived in a local area where more people commuted to work by private vehicle (OR 0.65). Those who had a longer commute times, regardless of travel mode, had greater odds of reporting more sitting during a typical weekday (OR 1.67). In turn, those who spent more time sitting had significantly greater odds of reporting poorer self-rated health (OR 1.34). Such work provides evidence to policy-makers to help build the argument for which area-level attributes are needed to support urban employment across a region.},

  abstract = {The city of Rethymno in Crete is the first Greek city to host a Dockless Bike Sharing System (DBSS). This is a scheme that means to promote sustainable mobility and help mitigating high levels of car traffic induced particularly during summer by a consistently increasing number of tourists. The present paper examines the efficiency of this DBSS aiming at: a) analysing the current usage patterns, b) identifying and discussing the various reasons that encourage or deter its use and c) capturing a few key user perceptions reflecting and affecting scheme acceptance and usage. The study adopts a mix-method approach consisting of secondary data analysis, field observations and a quantitative survey, completed by 534 DBSS users. The findings illustrate that DBSS is used primarily for short-distance trips (up to 1,5 km) and very short rentals (up to 15 min). Traffic safety concerns and limitations in the existing cycling infrastructure are two of the factors adversely affecting the scheme's usage, since many questioned whether the scheme was an effective investment under the present situation with the given constrains of Rethymno's transport system. The majority of both frequent and occasional users thought that the scheme is affordable, easy to use and suitable for both tourist and local populations. These findings constitute the first ever footprint of DBSS usage in Greece and can be used as an input for delivering appropriate policy interventions in future urban transportation strategies looking to promote and reinforce bike sharing usage and increase cycling uptake. The paper also offers valuable guidance to mobility providers about how bike sharing businesses can prosper long-term in an environment where shared mobility schemes constitute novel socio-technical interventions.},

This study examines this relationship, identifying associations between cycling or walking and self-reported health, whether socioeconomic status moderates these associations, and whether gentrification influences the potential moderating effects. This study uses the 2017 US National Household Travel Survey, subset to adults who lived in central cities (n = 91,541). Weighted logistic regression models with interaction terms were fit to estimate self-reported health status separately for cycling and walking. Gentrification was measured using an indicator based on previous research using US Census data. Cycling in the previous week and each additional walking trip were associated with higher odds of reporting better health. Socioeconomic status moderated the positive associations between active transportation and health for a few variables. Cyclists of color had smaller health effects from cycling for utilitarian trips, while race and ethnicity had only a marginal moderating effect on the association between walking and health. Gentrification was an insignificant moderating factor in general. Findings suggest planning efforts that continue to support programs that promote cycling and walking are crucial tools in the public health toolbox. The health gains from active transportation might be experienced in a variety of neighborhood contexts. Nevertheless, infrastructure investments and policy must be attentive to inequities across neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {Migrants in cities are highly dependent on frequent and fast public transport services. Easy access to rapid transit stations, such as subways or suburban rails, plays a crucial role in shaping migrants’ daily lives and critically influences integration processes at the local level. Nevertheless, in Europe, little is known about migrants’ access to rapid transport facilities. This article is the first one that provides comparable local indicators of rapid transit accessibility and equity in the supply of transit services for various migrant and non-migrant groups across 17 European cities. The analysis was based primarily on an innovative European spatial dataset about migrants’ concentration in cities as well as on several openly available general transit feed specification datasets. Methodologically, the authors used a classic gravity-based accessibility model, where the average frequency of daily departures was assumed as the attractiveness factor of the instrument. On the other hand, the authors performed Gini coefficient analysis and created Lorenz curve graphs to assess transit equity. The results allowed the authors to make inter or intracity comparisons and to demonstrate some of the most transit disadvantaged migrant communities in Europe. The findings suggest that Africans experience on average the worst access, while Americans, in the vast majority of cities, are located in high-access districts. Also, transit equity assessment demonstrated a high level of inequality across all population groups and cities, except Barcelona. A striking result was that 88\% of African communities in Turin shared only 10\% of rapid transit supply. However, it was confirmed that regardless of people’s nationality, in many cities around Europe, it is difficult for many dwellers to live in close proximity to subways. Therefore, better land-use and mobility policies are required to guide cities towards more inclusive and sustainable urban development.}

  abstract = {In this paper, the authors evaluate different elements of the urban micro-scale environment in eight European capitals' downtown areas (i.e. Vienna, Copenhagen, Warsaw, Madrid, Brussels, Budapest, Athens and Sofia) to provide insight into inequalities in walkability benefits due to spatial distribution. To this end, the authors utilize MAPS-Mini, the brief version of Microscale Audit of Pedestrian Streetscapes to record and assess, at the street level, 15 walkability related items based on the Google Street View service. Our total sample consists of about 15.736 street segments/crossings, while for reliability analysis reasons, a second rater was employed to cross assess 10\% of street segments per city. Results showed that Vienna and Athens had the highest (50.4\%) and lowest (32.1\%) overall walkability scores, respectively. Assessments were further combined with the population estimates of the European Urban Atlas 2012 dataset to perform equity analysis by estimating the distribution of average walkability scores among the population living downtown in the examined cities. In doing so, the authors used the Gini (G.) index and constructed Lorenz curve graphs. The authors’ findings reveal a landscape of high inequality in downtown walkability distribution since all Gini coefficients were higher than 0.43. However, the inequality was greatest in Brussels (G. = 0.60) and lowest in Budapest (G. = 0.43). Additionally, the authors used spatial statistics tests (i.e. global and local Moran's I) to identify global and local patterns of walkability and population. The results indicated a highly clustered pattern of walkability across all downtowns and designated several clusters of uneven walkability geographies. The authors’ approach sheds light on the application of active mobility strategies in different European cities, highlighting at the same time the need for further research to provide a clearer assessment of the spatial distribution of inequalities in social benefits and impact when designing sustainable urban neighbourhoods.}

This paper provides a practical framework for benchmarking and impact evaluation of public transportation infrastructure, which is demonstrated with a case study of Belo Horizonte in Brazil. It was found that the number of stops per kilometer of bus route is quite low in Belo Horizonte compared with other cities with similar population density, despite the city having a much larger bus network. Three types of opportunities were then considered: employment education, and potential for social interaction. An isochrone model was used for implementing the cumulative opportunities approach to measure accessibility. GTFS data were used to conduct simulations of transit schedules to obtain two accessibility indicators. The first finding shows that the public transportation system does not provide good connectivity to areas with high population density. While examining sensitivity to travel time thresholds, accessibility was found to increase with increase in travel time but not equally so for populations with different income levels. Lower income cohorts were seen to have lower accessibility than higher income counterparts, irrespective of the type of opportunity. It was found that transport network improvements should aim to reduce the income gap of 60\% of BPL population by at least 8\%. Finally, recommendations are provided for areas of investment by highlighting critical transit corridors and a critical but isolated underserved suburb. This framework can be easily applied to other case studies around the world.}

Spatial analysis was used to identify rental properties based on three inclusion criteria (affordability, proximity to public transportation, and proximity to grocery stores), three exclusion criteria (areas of high crime, prostitution, and sexual predator residence), and three suitability criteria (proximity to health care, mental health care, and youth serving organizations). The results were applied to four different scenarios to test the utility of the model. Of the 145 affordable rental properties, 27 met the criteria for safe and effective housing. Of these, 19 were located near bus routes with direct service to post-secondary education or vocational training programs. Only 6 were considered appropriate to meet the needs of youth who had children of their own. These outcomes highlight the complexities faced by youth when they attempt to find affordable and suitable housing following emancipation. The LEASE prototype demonstrates that spatial analysis can be a useful tool to assist with planning services for youth making the transition to independent living. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study analyzes one-way Average Commute Time (ACT) in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, specifically regarding its spatial pattern in relation to the urban center and the differences between cars and public transportation. It also explores the urban structure drivers as well as the social dimension. Results show that ACT is lower for car drivers than for transit users. The curve depicting the relationship between ACT and distance to the center differs between private car and public transit, being semi-flat for the former and an inverted U-shaped curve for the latter. There is a higher spatial correlation for transit ACT than for car ACT. Based on the results from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and spatial regression models, travel times from TRANUS transport model show that job accessibility plays a significantly inverse role in determining ACT for transit users and car users alike. However, this response is not consistent according to observed travel times from the 2017 Household Origin Destination Survey (HODS17). In regard to population groups, migrants and indigenous populations display significantly longer commute times, especially when using public transit, providing evidence that these groups are disadvantaged.}

Based on John Rawls’s theory of justice, the model focuses on maximizing the accessibility of those regions that are considered poor in terms of the current status of their accessibility. The model, formulated as a bilevel integer optimization problem, tries to establish a more equitable distribution of accessibility among various regions by allocating a limited budget to the candidate links of network development. As a case study on the real data of an interprovincial network in Iran, results indicate that the ratio of the population of groups with low and relatively low accessibility to the total population of the country has been reduced from 30\% in the initial situation to 11\%. Additionally, the min-to-max ratio of accessibility has increased from 3.09\% to 14.39\% in the current status since this theory is based on the maximization of benefits for the poorest groups in society.

Each jurisdiction identifies transportation justice (or environmental justice) areas based on their own methodology, typically based on either average regional thresholds, graduated thresholds, or a more unique in-house index methodology. This research explores and evaluates existing methods and develops a rigorous and comprehensive method called the Transportation Justice Threshold Index Framework (TJTIF) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as factors based on demographics, socio-economics, and transportation/land use. The framework is applied to a case study region in Pennsylvania reflective of the Marcellus Shale impact area, highlighting Sullivan County, PA.

In this context, the goals targeting poverty reduction and social well-being promotion become fundamentally undermined when the social impacts are overlooked in the decision-making process of transport development (Vasconcellos 2003; World Bank 2006; Jones and Lucas 2012; Jones et al. 2013).Hence, in a context where the transport-related needs have been either disregarded, not fully captured, or addressed by subjective approaches, the proposition of an objective and well-grounded screening framework of transport needs can play a pivotal role in making transport planning more socially inclusive. The framework that is proposed applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and spatial autocorrelation techniques to provide tools and evidence-based guidelines that can guide transport interventions in Northeast Brazil to become more effective in reducing poverty. While the socially driven framework that is outlined here focuses on the transport needs of Northeast Brazil, it can also be replicated in other developing countries facing similar socio-economic and transport challenges. The results show that different regions of Northeast Brazil suffer differently from externalities and that sub-regional analysis is needed.}

Gravity-based models are proposed based on travel impedance methods derived from i) Friction surface datasets, and ii) Kernel density maps. The spatial information is then aggregated at a municipality level creating indices that conjugate factors of severity and extent of SAP. The findings show that factors like deprivation of housing facilities (electricity and sanitation) and low population density are associated with critical SAP levels. The results also point out to higher prevalence of SAP in inner areas than the coastal areas of Northeast Brazil. The sensitivity analysis shows how data-poor contexts present a particularly complex environment to develop robust SAP measures. The findings emphasise the importance of considering sensitivity analysis and complementary factor analysis when applying SAP indicators for planning transport and for action prioritisation purposes. Since access to services and opportunities has been claimed to be a key difference between those who have escaped chronic poverty those still trapped in it, SAP indicators tailored to areas where poverty is most spread are of primary importance to promote a new standard of transport development strongly committed to eradicating poverty.}

We investigate geographic accessibility of Title X facilities and the relationship between geographic accessibility of Title X facilities and teenage birth rates in the state of North Carolina (NC). Methods Vehicular travel time from each ZCTA to its nearest Title X facility was calculated using a geographic information system and summarized as the indicator of geographic accessibility. We used bivariate and multiple spatial lag regressions to evaluate the relationship between ZCTA-level teenage birth rates (n = 754) in 2016 and geographic accessibility to a Title X facility, as well as socioeconomic and demographic factors. Results Nearly 60\% of teenage women lived 30 min or less from a Title X funded facility, while approximately 12\% of women lived 60 min or more from the nearest facility. In the regression models, percent non-Hispanic White, percent Hispanic, percent in Poverty, percent not enrolled in school, and population density were associated with teenage birth rates; however, geographic accessibility was only associated in the bivariate model. Conclusions Our findings show that geographic accessibility of Title X facilities is lower in NC than in other states. However, our results suggest that geographic accessibility is not related to teenage birth rates. Overall, these findings may indicate that publicly funded family planning facilities are underutilized by proximal populations or factors other than proximity act as a barrier to utilization.}

Binary logistic regression, independent-samples t-tests, and mapping techniques are employed to determine whether neighbourhoods with high SV (i.e. older populations, higher poverty rates, more service occupations, lower educational attainment, and a higher proportion of minorities) are as likely as those with low SV to exhibit a high degree of walkability. The publically available Walk Score (R) metric, based on proximity to amenities, street network connectivity, and density, was used as a proxy for neighbourhood walkability. The results indicate significant variability among cities, with Charlotte exhibiting the greatest potential for inequitable access to walkable urban environments and the most prominent concentration of "walk-vulnerable" block groups (BGs) with high SV and low walkability. Both Portland and Pittsburgh exhibited more equitable access when comparing BGs with high and low SV; however, they each presented unique spatial patterns, visualised using a series of maps.}

A mixed method approach was developed and applied in the sub-city of Mekelle, Ethiopia to measure objective and subjective QoL and to understand the divergence between the two. Focused group discussions, household surveys and walking interviews were the methods used for data collection and descriptive analysis, spatial analysis and content analysis were the methods of data analysis employed in this study. The results show that indicators such as 'access to health facilities' score a high level of objective QoL but low level of subjective QoL. Some citizens do not necessarily perceive their QoL condition in the same way as objective indicators do. By combining the subjective and objective QoL four states are identified: wellbeing, deprivation, adaptation and dissonance. Household's strategies and priorities explain adaptation to inadequate objective QOL conditions. Some of the main reasons for adaptation and dissonance are related to issues of access to basic infrastructure, housing ownership, housing affordability, quality of services, and having additional means of income and survival strategies. Understanding the reasons identified for adaptation and dissonance can be used to provide better evidence for the formulation and implementation of public policies.},

Using a microsimulation model built on a representative sample of the French population from 2012, it simulates the taxes levied on each household's consumption of energy for housing and transport. Without revenue recycling, the carbon tax is regressive and increases fuel poverty. From a policy perspective, this finding indicates that the question of fuel poverty cannot be ignored in the quest for a fair ecological transition. It proposes that some of the revenues from the carbon tax should be redistributed to households. Different designs of cash transfer to support households are then compared. The results show that the inequities of the carbon tax could be offset at reasonable cost relative to total carbon tax revenues. However, adjusting the design of cash transfers to criteria other than income level does not diminish the cost of compensating households. The benefits of finely adjusting cash transfers may therefore be somewhat limited. Most notably, the results show that targeting revenue recycling at low-income households would help to reduce fuel poverty substantially. This study therefore indicates that carbon taxation actually provides an opportunity to finance ambitious policies to fight fuel poverty.}

We propose a composite indicator that targets factors of vulnerabilities. In contrast to the previous indicators, it does not solely focus on budgetary aspects but also reflects conditions of mobility. Three levels of exposition to rising fuel prices are considered, depending on the combinations of factors. We test this indicator on French data and find that 7.8\% of French households are identified fuel poor, a further 7.4\% fuel vulnerable and a further 3.7\% fuel dependent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The equitable distribution of transit services is a major concern of transportation planners and policy makers worldwide. In the United States, planners are required by executive order to consider equity concerns when investing in new transportation infrastructure and services. However, equity can be difficult to assess in a consistent, objective, and quantitative way. Australian researchers recently developed a single, systemwide measure that reflects the equity of transit service distribution in a metropolitan area. This measure, known as a Gini coefficient, measures specifically how well transit supply meets transit demand. Transit supply is measured with a modified form of an established supply index, and demand is estimated with population and employment data. Although the idea of a single measure for assessing the equity of a transit system is appealing, researchers and practitioners must be careful when they implement Gini coefficients for comparative purposes. This research investigated the effect of selecting various scales, boundaries, and demand measures for calculating Gini scores for interregional comparisons. Gini coefficients were calculated for six urban transit systems within two boundaries (metropolitan statistical area and transit service area) at two scales (census tract and block group) with two demand measures (population and population plus employment). Results suggest that calculations with Gini coefficients on the basis of various boundary definitions can lead to drastically different comparative results, whereas the different scales and demand measures had little impact on interregional comparisons.}

An accessibility index was elaborated, taking into account motorization rates and the total surface of these fresh foods for sale within an easily accessible zone. The extent of that zone was determined differently for motorized (3 km) and non-motorized (500 m) consumers. Measures were calculated and georeferenced at the level of "Dissemination Areas" according to the 2001 Census.Results: In general, access to healthy foods is quite good for consumers who shop by car. But 40\% of the population have poor access to fruits and vegetables within a walkable distance from home. No relationship is observed between median income in dissemination areas and food supply.Conclusion: Improved access to healthy food by non-motorized consumers is needed in many areas of Montreal. Implications of differential access to fresh fruits and vegetables for health and environmental sustainability are discussed.}

To achieve this objective an exploratory survey was carried out with specialists involved in the urban planning processes of such cities. A total of 22 barriers were listed, and, using the Keiser criterion, these barriers were grouped into seven factors: (1) resources availability; (2) practical and technological; (3) city characteristics; (4) budget constrains; (5) social and cultural; (6) organizational; and (7) lack of infrastructure for sustainable vehicles; a grouping that, in general, was similar to those found in the literature. The first main barrier encountered in the municipalities analyzed were difficulties in finding mobility solutions that adequately meet all stakeholders' needs, followed by budget constraints for implementing actions toward more sustainable transport modes. Even though the complexity of the actors involved is seen as one of the main barriers to urban planning, it is still necessary to effectively involve the population in the decision-making process, so that all needs are considered, and consensual solutions are reached. Through the Spearman correlation method, other barriers closely associated with the first main barrier were reconciling the mobility needs of the population with the already existing infrastructure and preference for motor vehicles. For the second main barrier, other closely correlated variables were insufficient data collection for the preparation of urban mobility plans and lack of qualified workforce within municipal agencies to both elaborate and implement the actions contained in the plans. These correlations suggest that a deficient budget hinders the development of sustainable urban mobility in several stages of the process, including the diagnosis phase (data collection).}

Prior research on the anthropometry of WhMD users (n = 500) indicates that these dimensions are too small to accommodate the size of many occupied WhMDs, especially power chairs and scooters. This paper describes a development project designed to update the evidence for these technical criteria and communicate them to the vehicle designers and accessibility standards developers in a manner that would facilitate making good decisions. An interactive web-based design tool was developed for determining the dimensions of clear floor area to achieve a user-specified level of physical accommodation based on occupied device length and width measurements taken on 500 WhMD users. The web-based design tool is now available to practitioners who seek to accommodate a wider range of WhMD users than the minimum standards required by regulations. The design tool is also intended as a visual evidence base for regulatory activity and universal design practice with higher ambitions. The advent of driverless automated vehicles will increase the importance of accessibility and usability to accommodate the diversity of riders with disabilities. Clear floor space to enable independent ingress, interior circulation, and egress among WhMD users will be a foremost concern. The transportation industry, standards developers, disability advocates, mobility device manufacturers and prescribers, need to understand the limitations of current accessibility standards and work to address these limitations through updated vehicle design standards and policies.}

In comparing neighbourhoods on both walkability and a set of neighbourhood-level socioeconomic variables, we argue that walkability should be incorporated as part of a comprehensive framework for the analysis of processes of peripherilisation, since walkability should be seen as one relevant factor of urban capabilities, and hence the lack thereof fits into the definition of urban periphery.}

Low-income households are less likely to own cars and more likely to travel by modes other than the automobile. Less is known, however, about the specific determinants of travel among the poor, which was the purpose of this analysis. This study used data from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey to examine the relationship between income and automobile ownership and the role of automobile ownership in explaining person miles traveled. An analysis was then made of whether these determinants varied by income group. The results indicated that low-income adults rapidly convert rising income into additional mobility at faster rates than higher-income adults. Further, automobile ownership increases person miles traveled for all adults; however, it is particularly influential in increasing the travel of low-income adults. Households accrue greater marginal benefits by moving from zero to one vehicle than by purchasing additional vehicles when they already own one or more. These findings underscore the importance of automobile ownership to the mobility of low-income households and suggest an important role for policy in facilitating low-income auto ownership.},

  abstract = {In large developing cities, accessibility to opportunities is one of the key factors to improve social equity. Not only the quality and coverage of transit have an important role in this aspect, but also the patterns of urban growth, low-income settlement location, and road congestion. In terms of equity, transportation has an additional role related to externalities that have an impact on health, where low-income populations are the most exposed. This paper assesses the changes that improvement in transit in Bogota over the last 20~years has brought on equity, through better accessibility and lesser externalities. Based on data from OD surveys, changes are analyzed for inhabitants of different income levels, particularly those who use public transportation. During the period 1999–2019, improvement of Bogota's public transport system included the construction and expansion of the Transmilenio BRT, the implementation of the Integrated Public Transport System (SITP), and the application of subsidies for the poorest. However, despite the significant public and private investment, the overall generalized cost of commuting has increased by nearly 44\%, especially due to longer travel times generated by increasing congestion. This higher cost has had a more limited impact on the low-income population, whose main motorized mode is public transport. While the poorest still make a greater effort in time and money, per capita access to employment opportunities has increased by 24\%. Only half of the job opportunities for the low-income population would be reachable in one hour, compared to 85\% for the high-income segment. However, this gap has been reducing in the 2005–2019 period. Emissions due to mass transit improvement have decreased by 40\% and road fatalities by 27\%. This has certainly a positive impact on inequities caused by transportation, as low-income neighbourhoods have far worse indicators in terms of those externalities.}

The fragmentation analysis shows an increase in interactions for the three different income groups analysed in the 1995-2005 comparison. The spatial distribution of defragmented zones has also changed. Peripheral zones were isolated in 1995, close to ghettos or closed community concept, while in 2005 their interactions with the city saw an important improvement. The difference in difference analysis shows that feeder lines, serving specially those peripheral zones, have a positive impact on population as the fragmentation indicator decreases. However, no evidence was found regarding trunk line zones.}

In response, we designed a methodology that uses the concepts of accessibility and affordability as a complementary means for evaluating public transport investment, and identifying transport disadvantages and priorities for project generation. This is based on the calculation of accessibility levels to the labour market for different zones of a given city, by introducing a function of impedance composed by travel time budget and the percentage of income spent on transportation.The characteristics of time and percentage of income spent for accessing work obtained from transportation surveys define the "real accessibility" to employment for all the zones of a city. Then, a stated preference survey was applied in order to determine the desired expenditure in both variables, and the accessibility to jobs in this new situation was subsequently calculated. We calculated a third type of accessibility, using "standard" values of travel time and expenditure budget.This methodology is therefore used to evaluate different policies in Bogota, corresponding to changes in the fare structure of the existing public transport system, by proposing the development of cross subsidies, and carrying out an appraised on the impact of the development of a new Bus Rapid Transit line. The results show that depending on the population, its location and purchasing power, the impact of a redistributive fare with respect to accessibility to the labour market can be greater than the expansion and improvement of the public transport network.

Against this background, developing and evaluating indicators that quantify the distribution of public transport services from a social equity perspective is essential. The aim of the study is, therefore, to assess the equity of public transport services in four metropolitan regions in Brazil (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba and Recife) with two commonly used indicators of public transport provision. The first indicator measures proximity to rapid transit infrastructure (bus rapid transit, light rail and heavy rail stops with high frequency throughout the day), and the second measures accessibility to jobs by public transport. While simple indicators of proximity to public transport stops are most commonly used given their ease of operationalization and communication, accessibility to job indicators are more representative of the benefits provided to individuals by the public transport network. Combining these two indicators in one study provides a quantitative assessment of the socio-spatial distribution of public transport services in four large metropolitan areas in Brazil and the results demonstrate that lower-income households are disadvantaged in terms of public transport services in all four metropolitan areas. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of quantifying accessibility by public transport, in addition to proximity to rapid transit, and thereby sheds light on the importance of developing openly available public transport schedules and geographic data. This study is of relevance to planners and researchers wishing to measure and evaluate public transport equity in the Global South.},

  abstract = {Increasing attention is given to public transport services in cities of the Global South as a tool to enhance social inclusion and support economic development. Against this background, developing and evaluating indicators that quantify the distribution of public transport services from a social equity perspective is essential. The aim of the study is, therefore, to assess the equity of public transport services in four metropolitan regions in Brazil (São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba and Recife) with two commonly used indicators of public transport provision. The first indicator measures proximity to rapid transit infrastructure (bus rapid transit, light rail and heavy rail stops with high frequency throughout the day), and the second measures accessibility to jobs by public transport. While simple indicators of proximity to public transport stops are most commonly used given their ease of operationalization and communication, accessibility to job indicators are more representative of the benefits provided to individuals by the public transport network. Combining these two indicators in one study provides a comprehensive view of the socio-spatial distribution of public transport services in four large metropolitan areas in Brazil and the results demonstrate that lower-income households are disadvantaged in terms of public transport services in all four metropolitan areas. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of quantifying accessibility by public transport, in addition to proximity to rapid transit, and thereby sheds light on the importance of developing openly available public transport schedules and geographic data. This study is of relevance to planners and researchers wishing to measure and evaluate public transport equity in the Global South.}

  abstract = {Introduction: The ability to access healthcare services has long been considered a 'right' by Canadian citizens and is protected as such under the Canada Health Act. However, socio-spatial factors can limit access to healthcare services, especially for vulnerable populations. This paper aims to quantify the spatial accessibility to healthcare services by public transport across eight major Canadian metropolitan areas and compare accessibility to healthcare across vulnerable population groups. This is the first study, to the authors' knowledge, to conduct an assessment of accessibility to hospitals by public transport across multiple metropolitan regions in Canada, thereby allowing to identify common trends, challenges, as well as knowledge gaps.Methods: Spatial accessibility to general medical and surgical hospitals by public transport was measured through a two-step floating catchment area method, considering both service-to population ratios and travel time to these health services. For each metropolitan area, the average accessibility of all census tracts and the average accessibility of the 20\% most vulnerable census tracts were calculated. To quantify vertical equity, an indicator was subsequently developed using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between accessibility and vulnerability.Main findings: Within metropolitan areas (except for Vancouver), residents of vulnerable census tracts generally have greater access to hospitals by public transport. Yet, larger metropolitan areas (Calgary, Toronto-Hamilton, and Vancouver) tend to underperform in terms of vertical equity and average accessibility. In line with this, vulnerable census tracts in these metropolitan areas are characterized by the lowest levels of accessibility compared to vulnerable census tracts in the other metropolitan areas.Conclusion: This research highlights the challenges associated with the suburbanization of poverty in large Canadian metropolitan regions and the need to provide efficient public transport services to reach hospitals located in the periphery. It also shed lights on the necessity to conduct more empirical research to inform the implementation of guidelines in terms of accessibility to healthcare in Canada. This study is of relevance to researchers, planners and policy-makers wishing to improve accessibility to healthcare, especially for vulnerable populations.}

  abstract = {Accessibility, the ease of reaching destinations, is increasingly seen as a complimentary and in some cases alternative to the mobility oriented planning paradigm, as it allows capturing the complex interactions between land use and transportation systems while providing a social perspective on transportation planning. However, although accessibility has been extensively researched in the last decades, it is still largely marginalized in transportation planning practice. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to critically assess how accessibility is incorporated into metropolitan transportation plans and translated into performance indicators around the world, to ultimately derive policy recommendations. This research assesses 32 recent metropolitan transport plans from North America, Europe, Australia and Asia with respect to their goals, objectives and performance indicators. The results suggest that there is a trend toward a greater integration of accessibility objectives in transport plans, yet few plans have accessibility-based indicators that can guide their decision-making processes. Our findings show that in order to foster accessibility-based approaches to transportation planning, plans need to have clearly defined accessibility goals with a distinction between accessibility and mobility. Furthermore, multi-criteria analysis approaches including accessibility indicators need to guide the decision-making process. This study contributes to a greater understanding of the challenges and successes associated with implementing accessibility in transport planning.},

Valuations that can be applied for evaluating policies to improve perceived security are obtained. Consistent results are achieved, indicating that the method is promising for incorporating aspects in the physical environment in the welfare analysis. The results indicate a systematic variation in value of walk time in different physical environments and it is more dependent of the physical environment for women than for men. This paper thereby contributes to the literature by showing that results by social sciences can be verified using methods and theories traditionally used in transport and welfare analysis and may therefore be incorporated in standard CBA. A contribution of this study is the insight that the perception of insecurity involved in accessing the public transport system is a welfare loss that can be quantified. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, however, quantitative evidence of disparities in access to bike lanes has been limited to a small number of cities. We addressed this research gap by examining cross-sectional associations between bike lanes and sociodemographic characteristics at the block group level for 22 large U.S. cities (n = 21,843 block groups). Dependent variables included the presence (yes/no), coverage, connectivity, and proximity of bike lanes, measured using secondary GIS data collected by each of the 22 cities between 2012 and 2016. Primary independent variables included indicators of race, ethnicity, educational attainment, income, poverty, and a composite socioeconomic status (SES) index, all measured using data from the 2011-2015 American Community Survey. We used linear and logistic multilevel mixed-effects regression models to estimate associations between these sociodemographic characteristics and each bike lane dependent variable, before and after adjusting for traditional indicators of cycling demand (population and employment density, distance to downtown, population age structure, bicycle commuting levels). In unadjusted associations, disadvantaged block groups (i.e. lower SES, higher proportions of minority residents) had significantly lower access to bike lanes. After adjusting for indicators of cycling demand, access to bike lanes was lower in block groups with particular types of disadvantage (lower educational attainment, higher proportions of Hispanic residents, lower composite SES) but not in those with other types of disadvantage (higher proportions of black residents, lower income, higher poverty). These results provide empirical support for advocates claims of disparities in bike lane access, suggesting the importance of more closely considering social equity in bicycle planning and advocacy.}

The disease and injury burden was assessed from traffic-related accidents, air pollution, noise and physical (in) activity, and impacts attributed back to modal source. In total, road transport was found to be responsible for 650 deaths in 2012 (2.1\% of annual mortality): 308 from traffic accidents, 283 as a result of air pollution, and 59 from noise. Together with morbidity, these represent a total burden of disease of 26,610 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). An estimated 40 deaths and 1874 DALYs were avoided through active transport. Cars are responsible for about 52\% of attributable deaths, but heavy goods vehicles (6\% of vehicle kilometres travelled, vkt) accounted for 21\% of deaths. Motorcycles (1 per cent of vkt) are implicated in nearly 8\% of deaths. Overall, impacts of traffic-related air pollution and noise are low compared to other developed countries, but road accident rates are high. Results highlight the need for policies targeted at road accidents, and especially at heavy goods vehicles and motorcycles, along with more general action to reduce the reliance on private road transport. The study also provides a framework for national indicator development.}

However, active transport in these studies was operationalized with self-reported measures, which poorly approximate physical activity. Unfortunately, objective accelerometer data are very expensive to obtain in large-scale travel studies.Purpose: To benefit from a large sample and objective physical activity data, this study linked a cross-sectional household travel survey with accelerometer data from a small sample to investigate the association between socioeconomic disadvantage and the daily level of transport-related moderate-to vigorous physical activity (T-MVPA) in an adult population (35-83 years).Methods: Accelerometer data for participants' trips over 7 days from the RECORD GPS Study (7138 trips, 229 participants) were combined with information on participants' trips over 1 day from the Global Transport Survey (Enquete Globale Transport, EGT) (82084 trips, 21332 participants). Trip-level T-MVPA data from the RECORD sample were used to train a random forests prediction model, enabling the prediction of T-MVPA for each participant's trip from EGT. The associations between socioeconomic indicators and daily T-MVPA were analyzed with negative binomial regression models.Results: An average time of 18.9 min (95\% confidence interval: 18.6-19.2) of T-MVPA was found for these 35-83 year old adults. The education level had a positive association with T-MVPA. Household income had a negative association with T-MVPA, especially for those people without a motorized vehicle.Conclusions: This study developed a methodology exporting precise sensor-based knowledge to a large survey sample to shed light on population-level socioeconomic disparities in transport-related physical activity.

Despite the importance of these indicators, the academic community has done little in terms of a critical reflection on their choice, relevance, framing and operationalization. This holds for many SDG domains, also for the urban sector domain of target 11. To partially address this void, we aim to critically review the UN methodology for the urban access indicator, SDG indicator 11.2. In discussing its conceptual framing against the background of paradigm shifts in transportation planning, we argue that this indicator has a number of shortcomings. The most important one is that it is supply oriented and measures access to transportation infrastructure, rather than accessibility to activity locations. As an alternative, we develop two accessibility indicators that show substantial variation in accessibility across geographical areas. We implement all indicators for the city of Bogota in Colombia, using a geo-information based approach. Our results show that SDG indicator 11.2 fails to represent the transport reality well. Its supply oriented focus neglects transport demand, oversimplifies the transport system and hides existing inequalities. Moreover, it does not provide useful evidence for targeting new interventions. The proposed accessibility indicators provide a more diverse, complete and realistic picture of the performance of the transport system. These indicators also capture the large spatial and socio-economic inequalities and can help to target improvements in urban transportation.},

Carefully planned and appropriately executed interchanges facilitate integration between different modes of public transport, allow passengers to shorten journey duration and to reduce effort required to change the means of transport.  The question is how to evaluate and compare the advantages and disadvantages caused by various interchanges. The proposed method includes a comprehensive analysis of many aspects of the accessibility of interchanges for passengers. On the one hand, it takes into account the distance to go between tram/bus stops within the interchange, but on the other hand, it considers the quality of the infrastructure maintenance of stops and footpaths, availability and comprehensiveness of information for passengers and personal safety and the safety of traffic as well as the qualitative dimensions of these indicators.  The usefulness of the method is presented on the basis of the assessment of selected interchanges in Krakow.}

This research contributes to filling this gap by developing a practical approach to evaluate the impact of fare subsidization on vertical equity. This paper implements a two-step methodology. First, two main indicators were developed to measure the social impact of the travel pass, a highly subsidized fare, to determine the effectiveness of the policy in reaching lower-income citizens. Second, by using the latest disaggregated data from a transportation survey, in Madrid, Spain, a multiple regression model revealed that travel pass usage (TPU) depended mainly on income level and accessibility to public transport. The results show that the accessibility level has a positive effect on the TPU indicator, whereas income level has a negative influence. Because income level is shown to play the most significant role in influencing public transport use, the subsidy policy associated with the travel pass in the city can be considered progressive, since it effectively targets economically disadvantaged groups. This fact suggests that subsidies for public transport in Madrid tend to favor vertical equity.},

Taking into account an elastic demand associated with each proposed charging scenario, the related distributional effects are explored using the Theil index, with a quantitative assessment of the inequalities in the accessibility variations across the users of the network.}

An extensive sensitivity analysis investigates how the costs of the system vary with respect to the achieved level of equity.

A proxy of the distance from major roads, mathematical modelling, and exposure as established by pollutant measurement are three of the main techniques developed to determine environmental inequity with regard to a particular group in the broader population. A number of the studies performed have concluded that the low-income population and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities tend to reside in the most polluted areas. The main objective of this article is to compare the results obtained from three techniques for analyzing the spatial concentration of pollutant emissions on the Island of Montreal. The second objective is to determine whether groups vulnerable to air pollutants namely, individuals under 15 years old and the elderly and those who tend to be located in the most polluted areas-i.e., visible minorities and the low-income population are affected by environmental inequities associated with air pollution. The results obtained from the three techniques for evaluating environmental equity firstly show that there are differences between these techniques. Secondly, they show that the groups selected based on age are not affected by environmental inequities. Finally, they indicate that the low-income population and, to a lesser extent, visible minorities in Montreal more frequently live near major roads and in areas with higher pollutant concentrations.

  abstract = {The deployment of HSR services in the recent decades has been, arguably, the most significant innovation for intercity travel around the globe. HSR has brought impacts which have been widely studied in different countries in relation to the different socioeconomic, territorial and transport characteristics.This paper analyses the economic growth, the transport accessibility and the social impacts observed in Italy after ten years of HSR operation, as well as the estimated impacts of the system completion. The Italian case study is of particular interest since along the 1,467 km of new high speed line (300 km/h), a combination of major cities distances and a unique HSR competitive market, producing prices reductions and more daily trains, brought a 200\% increase of HSR demand (from 15 to 45 millions of passengers/year). Estimations results show that, on average, HSR in Italy contributed to a significant increase in transport accessibility (+32\%) for the zones along the HSR network, while only marginal for the others (+6\%). Impacts on the economic growth show that HSR has contributed to an extra growth of per capita GDP of + 2.6\% in 10 years and would have contributed to a further increase of 3.6\% if the final project scenario (HSR\_N) would had been completed by 2018. Regional (horizontal) equity impacts were evaluated in terms of the Gini indexes variations with respect to the distribution of the transport accessibility. It results that HSR in Italy has decreased equity in terms of users' travel time accessibility of 11\%, increasing the differences between the zones served by HSR and those not. If the HSR\_N scenario would have been completed equity indices would have increased of 29\% with respect to the pre-HSR 2008 scenario, thus reducing regional inequalities in the country.Results show that the HSR project was a country-level "game changer" in Italy, suggesting that the wider economic benefits, the assumptions on market regulation, the effects on regional disparities and the compensatory measures should be included in the ex ante and ex post evaluation of similar projects.}

The estimated investment equation is derived from a general specification of the government's objective function (Berhman and Craig, Am. Econom. Rev. 77 (1987) 315), which accounts both for, the equity-efficiency trade-off and for deviations from this rule that arise because of political factors. The reaction of investment to changes in the regional output provides information about the strength of the equity-efficiency trade-off. The main political factor considered is a measurement of the electoral productivity of funds invested in each region. The equation is estimated from panel data on investment and the capital stock of transportation infrastructure (i.e., roads, rails, ports and airports) for the Spanish departments (NUTS3) during the period 1987-1996. We use a dynamic specification of the equation that allows for slow adjustment and which is estimated by GMM methods (Arellano and Bond, Rev. Econom. Stud. 58 (1991) 277). The results suggest that efficiency criteria play only a limited role in the geographical distribution of government infrastructure investment. Specific regional infrastructure needs and political factors both appear to be factors that do explain the regional allocation of infrastructure investment. (c) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Policies focused on reducing public transport fares are aimed at improving social inclusion and leading to a modal shift. The City of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, has recently introduced a fare-free public transport (FFPT) service in an effort to improve accessibility and mobility for its residents. The case of Tallinn is a full-scale, real-world experiment that provides a unique opportunity for investigating the impacts of FFPT policy. A macrolevel empirical evaluation of FFPT impacts on service performance, passenger demand, and accessibility for various groups of travelers is presented. In contrast to previous studies, the influence of FFPT on passenger demand was estimated while changes in supply were controlled. The results indicate that the FFPT measure accounts for an increase of 1.2\% in passenger demand, with the remaining increase attributed to an extended network of public transport priority lanes and increased service frequency. The relatively small effect could be attributed to the previous price level and public transport share as well as analysis of the short-term impact. The evidence-based policy evaluation in this paper is instrumental in supporting policy making and facilitating the design of public transport pricing strategies.},

Although this is a well-defined field of research, this paper should be seen as a contribution to the debate on the understanding of disability as a product of processes of human-environment interaction and as an attempt to address issues of mobility for people with disabilities by taking into account their personal characteristics and capabilities. Current methodological and operational efforts on the role of spatial configuration as a means for improving the autonomy of people with ASD focus almost exclusively on the design of closed, separated, private spaces, devoted only to people with ASD (mainly children). Starting from these considerations, the paper describes a research project aimed at defining an integrated set of urban mobility policies and extra-small urban design projects to provide people with ASD a real opportunity of using their city.}

The attributes Included in this experiment are: audio-visual information at bus stops, elevation of stops, buses' access ramps, and time of travel. Based on the data collected from the survey, discrete choice models were estimated to obtain the preferences and valuations of individuals for the elements, with a focus on people with reduced mobility. The results show that individuals with reduced mobility value at least twice the accessibility elements than people without reduced mobility.}

In this paper we argue for the wider use of accessibility indicators as part of the long-range transportation planning process. As a case example, changes in job accessibility indices are traced for the San Francisco Bay Area from 1980 to 1990, computed for 100 residential areas and the region's 22 largest employment centers. Indices are refined based on occupational match indicators that weigh the consistency between residents' employment roles and labor-force occupational characteristics at workplaces. The analysis reveals that peripheral areas tend to be the least job accessible. Moreover, employment centers that are home to highly skilled professional workers are generally the most accessible when occupational matching is accounted for. This is thought to reflect the existence of housing markets that are more responsive to the preferences of upper-income workers. Our analyses also show that residents of low-income, inner-city neighborhoods generally face the greatest occupational mismatches. Through a path analysis, the variable 'race' was found to be far more strongly associated with unemployment than was job accessibility, however, even after controlling for educational levels and other factors. We conclude that an important purpose of tracking changes in accessibility is to provide feedback on the degree to which resource allocation decisions in the urban transportation field are helping to redress serious inequities in accessibility to jobs, medical facilities, and other important destinations.}

We considered the distribution of general pediatricians and neonatologists relative to the geographical distribution of children using the two-step floating catchment area method, which accounts for the pediatrician-to-children ratios within catchment areas with defined travel distance (TD) thresholds. All measurements were carried out within a geographic information system. We found varied growth rate trends of children within the 61 municipalities of Chiba Prefecture between 1995 and 2006. The eastern and southern areas of the prefecture were less populated and had a small number of children in contrast to the central and northwestern areas, which had higher density of child population, less negative growth rates and even positive growth rate trends in some municipalities. For neonatology services, we used the number of live births (LB) and low birth weight (LBW) infants as populations. Lower LBW rates were found within the northern area while higher LBW rates were found within the southern area (minimum, 3.1\%; maximum, 18.4\%). The average LBW rate was 9.0\% in Chiba Prefecture, whereas it was 9.5\% for all Japan in 2005. SA analysis showed that 98.8\% of children distributed within a 10 km TD threshold from a hospital with general pediatric services, and that 82.3\% of LB and LBW distributed within a 30 km TD threshold from a hospital with neonatology services. The distribution of pediatricians relative to the population they serve was not homogeneous at local level. Through the methodology applied, we visualized areas short of pediatric services. The assessment of SA at local level provided informative results to achieve social equity in hospital access. The practical implications of this study are the need for reliable data for research purposes and policy development for children.}

  abstract = {U.S. public transit agencies struggle to attract and retain riders. Unprecedented public investments have been made over the past several decades for expanding and improving transit service across cities. Unfortunately, however, there is no evidence of increase in ridership once growth in population and aggregate travel demand are accounted for. Consequently, the quest for boosting patronage continues. The challenge, experts argue, is to attract people out of cars.In this paper, I use a recent state-wide travel survey from California and take advantage of a new comprehensive historical archive of regional real-time multi-modal transportation system data to explore contexts in which persons belonging to car-owning households within Los Angeles County use transit for their commute.I find that few car owners use transit, and that lack of access to the household vehicle(s) explain choice of transit to a large extent. While discretionary transit use (or transit use by choice) is rare, I find evidence that fast (relative to car), frequent and reliable transit service along with fewer transfer requirements strongly correlate with car-owners' transit mode choice. Home and workplace neighborhood density, proximity to transit stop, and availability of rail are other critical facilitators. Even if observed effects are due, in part, to self-selection, there are important lessons for transit planners. For example, results suggest that all else equal: reduction in transit-to-auto travel time ratio by unity can increase odds of transit mode choice by about 25\%; reduction in headway by 10 min can increase the odds by about 30\%, and; lowering the standard deviation of schedule deviation from over to under three minutes can result in 2.6 times increase in the odds.This paper identifies effective strategies for increasing transit's competitiveness relative to auto, and hence attracting people out of their cars. While rail network expansion programs and transit-oriented development efforts must continue across U.S. cities, it is important that planners also advocate for investments in key dimensions of bus service quality that patrons value, such as speed, frequency and reliability. Efficient network designs that reduce transfer requirements, introduction of bus rapid transit services, and improvements in real-time operations, scheduling and long-range planning by using ITS (intelligent transportation systems) infrastructures across modes are critical. This study shows that careful planning can promote discretionary transit use by attracting existing latent demand and by creating new demand in an era of increasing government interest in transit and growing traffic congestion. Broader positive effects on the travelling public and the environment are much greater than what this study can predict.}

It combines the output from a chemistry transport model, a health impact model and other impact models within a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework. As a proof-of-concept, the MCDA framework is used to evaluate and compare idealized emission reduction policies in four sectors (combustion in energy and transformation industries, non-industrial combustion plants, road transport and agriculture) and across six outcomes or criteria (mortality, health inequality, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity, crop yield and air quality legal compliance). To illustrate a realistic use of the MCDA framework, the relative importance of the criteria were elicited from a number of stakeholders acting as proxy policy makers. In the prototype decision problem, we show that reducing emissions from industrial combustion (followed very closely by road transport and agriculture) is more advantageous than equivalent reductions from the other sectors when all the criteria are taken into account. Extensions of the MCDA framework to support policy makers in practice are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An accessibility measure is applied to evaluate the loss of transportation set-vice and, in particular, its attendant spatial disparities. Alternative repair and restoration strategies are investigated and shown, in hindsight, to be preferable to the actual sequence of repairs. The second case study focuses on the potential loss of road and highway transportation in Seattle, WA, after a hypothetical earthquake. A refined accessibility measure is applied that accounts for postdisaster detouring and congestion. Again, this brings attention to spatial disparities in loss and the spatial implications of alternative restoration priorities. It further demonstrates that restoration strategies should be designed from a systems perspective. The limitations and broader applicability of the approach are discussed.}

This is achieved by dividing the urban space into a multilevel grid that can be easily combined with grid-based population data to facilitate accessibility modeling, calculation, and evaluation. Additionally, an acquisition method for more accurate travel time data in the multimodal public transportation network was developed on the basis of an Internet mapping service. This provides a realistic, multimodal, door-to-door modeling approach that avoids the requirement of building complex traffic networks through Geographic Information System (GIS) software and simplifies road network modeling efforts.

However, there is no comprehensive approach to elevate the role of accessibility in evaluating transportation system over social equity by considering the variety of urban opportunities and population groups from green transportation perspective. Our goal is to develop such a framework to evaluate transportation equity by focusing on accessibility via transit and cycling. Applying the framework to Fresno, California, and Cincinnati, Ohio with different development patterns, we delineate service areas at block-group level with five time-thresholds. The service area is used to count the number of urban opportunities: jobs, dining, churches, libraries, parks, multi-use paths, schools. We then use statistical comparison and geographical mapping to identify accessibility gap to these opportunities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups defined by income, property value, education, vehicle ownership, race, and age. The results indicate the extent of differences in accessibility is sensitive to threshold specification of grouping population. The findings suggest that the efficiency of transit service needs to be improved to reach the same level of cycling, while they do help with the accessibility for economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Considering school enrollment, the accessibility to opportunities in Fresno performs differently while students in Cincinnati benefit from good accessibility to most resources. The results of accessibility to multi-use paths highlight the need of providing more efficient green transportation facilities for less wealthy neighborhoods. Variation in accessibility between groups underscores the importance of developing policies to meet the needs of diverse social groups.}

Geographic information systems (GIS)-based accessibility has been widely employed to measure the inequity of access to healthcare facilities. However, the focus in literature lies generally on spatial patterns; few accessibility studies have focused on temporal inequity. This study focuses on the disparity of the elderly's healthcare inequity (EHI) in both spatial and temporal dimensions.Methods: EHI is measured by the elderly's medical services accessibility (EMSA) scores. Based on a road network analysis with real-time traffic data acquired by a Python-based web crawler, a Gaussian two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method is employed to calculate EMSA scores. Sensitivity analysis is presented for three threshold times (i.e., 5, 15, and 30 min) and different intervals of a time of day (TOD) period.Results: In the temporal patterns, the average EMSA (EMSA-avg) scores of daily variations vary from 0.0262 to 0.0556 at t(0) = 5 min, from 0.0704 to 0.1073 at t(0) = 15 min, and from 0.1734 to 0.2223 at t(0) = 30 min. Meanwhile, three "low value intervals (LVIs)" exist in TOD period. In the spatial patterns, the areas with frequent traffic congestions or no nearby hospitals are characterized by low-level accessibility for the 5 min catchment, while the same level areas for the 30 min are far from the city centre and equipped with inconvenient public transportation.Conclusions: The findings may help the policymakers in planning the medical service resources for the growing aging population and providing caregivers information for a timely and effective medical treatment.}

Therefore, we used real-time travel time to extend an existing spatial accessibility method to measure the spatiotemporal accessibility of fire services in a case study of Nanjing, China. The results show that (1) the overall accessibility of fire incidents and fire stations in Nanjing, China, is uneven, with relatively high accessibility in the southwest and northeast of the city center; (2) the number of fire incidents with low-level accessibility apparently increases in rush hours (i.e., 07:00-09:00 and 17:00-19:00 h) in the southeast and north of the city center, and the fire incidents with medium-level and high-level accessibility easily change to lower levels under the influence of traffic congestion, with fire incidents with medium-level accessibility being affected the most; (3) the accessibility of fire stations changes over time with an obvious W pattern, with lower accessibility during rush hours than at other times, and several fire stations in the city center present an asymmetric W pattern; (4) the accessibility decline ratio for fire stations in rush hours is greater in the city center than in urban suburbs, and the decline ratios are strongly related to the travel time increase and the percent increase in uncovered fire incidents during rush hours. The results and findings demonstrate that our method can be used to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of the accessibility of fire services, and so can guide policymakers in improving fire services.}

Access to a transit system with frequent bus service could help ensure participation by elderly citizens in activities at greater distances from their homes.

The resulting model includes both monetary and nonmonetary indicators, and involves multiple measurement items, dimensions, and related weights. Then, this fuzzy multidimensional assessment approach of travel deprivation is used to measure the travel deprivation in the underdeveloped, small city of Lhasa, China. The results identified both differences and similarities between different parts of the city. Among all measured dimensions, the following four dimensions cause strong travel deprivation: disposable income, travel service quality, travel time, and available transportation. Differences in the travel deprivation were identified between different parts of Lhasa, indicating multidimensional travel deprivation. Furthermore, an early warning analysis on travel deprivation and an assessment of different levels of residents' travel deprivation in underdeveloped cities are presented. These findings provide an effective evaluation of the current situation of travel inequity in underdeveloped small cities.}

To this end, we draw on the 2015 Nanjing Travel Survey and the city's GIS database. Instead of assuming a fixed threshold, this paper applies a spatial expansion model to allow for person- and location-specific walking distances to measure accessibility. The spatial disparities in access to recreational amenities are evaluated using the notion of vertical equity for identifying areas that are better-off or worse -off. Our results show pronounced distributional effects of current land-use and transportation policies for different age cohorts. In particular, elderly people experience lower accessibility to chess/card rooms and urban parks than their younger counterparts. The empirical evidence in this research can inform planning and policy interventions and feed current scientific debates on the role of accessibility in addressing social inclusion for an age-friendly society.}

This study examines the mode choice of low-income commuters based on an activity-based travel survey in Fushun, China. A model of integrated choice and latent variables was utilized to construct and test the significance of sociodemographics, activity attributes, and latent attitudinal variables. More specifically, a "multiple indicators, multiple causes" model was used to construct the latent variables postulated to be important for travel mode choice, and a multinomial logit model was employed to test the significance of explanatory variables. Results indicate that gender, age, and driving license possession play an important role in the formation of these underlying factors: comfort, convenience, reliability, flexibility, safety, and environmental preferences. On several accounts the latent-variable-enriched choice model outperforms the traditional choice model and provides insights into the importance of unobservable variables in the choice process. Preferences for the latent variables except flexibility are found to exert a significant influence on the mode choice of low-income commuters. Reliability is shown to be helpful in increasing the likelihood that low-income commuters will choose public transit. The sociodemographics and activity attributes also have important effects on the choice process. Findings should provide useful information to policy makers and transportation planners to improve the mobility of low-income commuters.}

What is the impact of high-speed rail (HSR) on regional economic disparity? The question is investigated from three perspectives. First, the influence of HSR on regional economic disparity is discussed theoretically from the perspective of New Economic Geography. Second, the variation in economic disparity at both the national and regional levels is investigated using three indexes: the weighted coefficient of variation, the Theil index and the Gini index. Third, the linkages between regional economic growth and HSR is measured empirically from a quantitative and qualitative perspective using an endogenous growth modelling framework with a panel data covering the period 2000-2014. The rail network density is adopted as a proxy to reflect the quantity change in rail investment. Three accessibility indicators (weighted average travel time, potential accessibility and daily accessibility) are introduced to capture the improvement of HSR transport quality. Our findings confirm that regional economic disparity has been decreased since the development of HSR. HSR has promoted regional economic convergence in China. Specifically, the positive effect of rail network density on regional economic growth is found to be significant in the East and North, whereas the positive effect of accessibility change is found to be more significant in the Middle Reaches of Yangtze River, the Southwest and the South China.}

The location of age-restricted communities that serve older adults aged 65 or older can influence accessibility to goods and services and further affect the health and quality of life of seniors. However, few quantitative indicators are available to judge whether the accessibility between these communities and neighboring facilities is appropriate. Therefore, this study presents a spatial analysis framework for age-restricted communities from a regional-local perspective. The regional analysis explores the spatial distribution of age-restricted communities, while the local analysis involves the accessibility measure of these communities to necessary neighboring facilities by type, age-friendly community identification, and a comprehensive accessibility evaluation. This framework is then applied to investigate three types of age-restricted communities in Edmonton, Canada. The results indicate that age-restricted communities are predominantly located centrally in the city, while population aging is not of a high degree in all of these neighborhoods. Some communities are regarded as friendly to older adults, but, excluding nearby bus stops and emergency medical services (EMS) stations, the options for different amenities among these communities are not diverse. The elderly in independent living communities tend to have better access to necessary neighboring facilities. The proposed methodology can be used for accessibility analysis of age-restricted communities for different stakeholders and can also lead to existing and proposed improvements to enhance age-friendliness in neighborhood design.}

However, an imbalanced distribution of public transport services across a population may result in adverse effects for some social groups. One of these, the senior population, is seeing rapid growth, giving rise to increasing concerns. In this context, this paper develops a systematic methodology, supported by Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to identify the relative spatial gaps in public transport supply and demand from seniors, such as census tracts (CTs), traffic analysis zones (TAZs), or neighborhoods, considering sustainability at the statistical area (SA) level. A case study of Edmonton, Canada is described to demonstrate the novelty and practical capabilities of this methodology. The presented results indicate that the concentration degree of transport services varies among all CTs and reflects diversity in terms of various transport supply indicators, but the Gini coefficients of the seniors are all found to be relatively small. Distribution of the public transport supply index (PTSI) and the public transport demand index (PTDI) are found to be diverse among all CTs in terms of geographical locations and the number of CTs in different categories. It is also found that Edmonton features some easily distinguishable over-serviced and under-serviced areas, as well some CTs with balanced service-usually in suburban locations far from the city's core. The findings provide policy makers with evidence to validate a quantitative method for evaluating the relative spatial gaps in public transport services for individual CTs in order to promote greater equality of transport opportunities and increase of transport service efficiency among socially disadvantaged groups.

Meanwhile, reducing reliance on private transport (e.g., car use) and raising public transport usage (e.g., bus, metro, light rail, bicycle) is frequently a major goal of transport strategies. Against this background, this study measures the MAG in multi-modal transportation networks from two perspectives: mobility (travel modes and traffic conditions) and proximity (the location and attractiveness of the destination) and describes the methodology developed for an application across the metropolitan area of Nanjing, China. The results show substantial differences between public and private transport in a multi-modal urban network environment based on a realistic "door-to-door" model. In addition, we find that the accessibility advantage of cars is always better than the transit and cycling modes but only from a mobility perspective. The analysis of the sustainability of urban transport should also take account of the location and service capability of the destination and the influence of traffic congestion. The patterns of the smallest MAG scores between the transit and car modes are concentrated along metro and bus routes, and thus they change with traffic fluctuations. On the contrary, the patterns of the smallest MAG scores between the cycling and car modes are concentrated in central urban areas and are thereby affected by traffic conditions including road destiny, river obstacles, and the cross-river channel. Finally, the range of the lowest MAG scores shows a broader distribution in central urban areas in peak hours compared with in off-peak hours.}

The level of service standards were defined using Law of Successive Interval Scaling based on data collected from 2000 travelers in Kolkata city. As premium and ordinary bus services are predominantly used by choice riders (private car owners) and captive riders (non-car owners) respectively, LOS standards of these two services were defined based on the perception of choice and captive riders. The result shows a substantial difference in the perception of captive and choice riders which justifies the need for having distinct service standards for ordinary and premium services. The study also evaluated the level of service of a few premium and ordinary routes based on the developed service standards. The evaluation indicated that while the premium buses are introduced to attract the choice riders, a majority of them are operating below the expected service levels and thus, unable to fulfil the requirements of choice riders. The LOS standards developed in the present work may be used judiciously by the transit planners and service providers for improvement of premium and ordinary bus service in Kolkata city. Although the level of service standards developed in the present work are city specific, the work is of interest to the policy makers of public transport as several emerging countries are experiencing rapid urbanization and public transport has to play a dual role to serve the mobility needs of marginally weaker segments (captive riders) and act as a demand management instrument to attract choice riders.}

The overarching aim of this paper is to evaluate socio-demographic, health and mobility-related factors correlated with health-related quality of life among people aged between 75 to 90 years old in three Swedish Municipalities.Methods: Within the SEBEM study, a cross-sectional survey using a self-administered postal questionnaire was conducted among 2398 older people aged between 75 and 90 years. Primary outcome of the study was health-related quality of life measured using the SF12 which distinguishes two dimensions of health, i.e. the Physical Composite Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the variability study outcomes. Multilevel regression models were used to investigate factors independently correlated with health, controlling for the influence of potential confounders.Results: Higher physical and mental self-reported health is associated with walking more than 500 m on a daily basis, use of a private car and frequent engagement in social activities. Access to the car is only associated with physical health. Mental health scores are significantly lower among those living far from the closest bus stop and never using public transport.Discussion: We provide evidence of epidemiological associations between access to public mobility services and good health in older age. Given the cross-sectional design of our analyses, and the related limitations, the associations found should be investigated more thoroughly by future studies using longitudinal and/or experimental designs.},

The conceptualization and measurement of transport service quality-a fundamental determinant of demand-poses challenges for conducting economic analyses and designing mobility policies.Several operating companies are involved in the transport sector. In this paper, the bus network of the metropolitan area of Granada, Spain, is taken as a case study. The aim is to design a model of overall satisfaction based on level of satisfaction using a specific set of factors that take into account the individual characteristics of users and the differential effect of using different bus lines.A combined method using nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) and a logit multilevel model (LMLM) in two steps is applied to a satisfaction survey conducted by the Metropolitan Transport Consortium of Granada (Consorcio de Transporte Metropolitano del area de Granada) in 2013. The survey shows that even though customers within the metropolitan area of Granada are satisfied with the service received (67.26\%), the level of satisfaction is not equal for all bus lines, with the perceived quality of some lines being above or below the average. This differential effect is due to different reasons, including the technical and functional performance of the operating companies, commercial speed and length and type of route, among others. Both the operators and the public administration need to focus their attention on these lines in order to design economic policy measures to improve bus lines with below standard compliance.}

To this end, we examined previous co-creation frameworks in the transportation context, and carried out qualitative, comparative research in two stages (Study 1, designing the experience for people with disability, and Study 2, designing the experience with people with disability) with 37 participants. Our methodology consisted of focus groups, shadowing participants during the transportation experience, and post-experience surveys with semi-structured questions. The study explains how ensuring adequate communication encounters with participants before the experience can guarantee a successful design of the urban transportation experience. The results will provide clear guidance to transport network managers on how to allocate proper adapted communication resources to PwD for improving accessibility before the transportation experience takes place.}

The success of these networks relies on multimodal transfers. However, making a transfer means more time will be spent outside the vehicle compared with a direct route, and for women, this means being exposed to the urban environment of stations for longer. The purpose of this study is to investigate the role gender plays in people's decisions to make transfers, in order to develop integrated systems that are equitable. A survey was undertaken in three major cities in New Zealand. A total of 2, 173 people, car drivers, and PT users participated. Results show that women drivers are 30\% more likely than men to make a transfer, given time savings. Waiting time is the most influential factor and has a greater effect on women's decisions to make transfers. The factor "perceived safety at stations" was only significant for female riders. With the presence of security guards, female car drivers were three times more likely to ride a route with transfer, compared with males who were two times more likely. Women, car drivers, and PT users were slightly more likely to make a transfer given good quality information and covered walkways. It is expected that these results will provide practitioners with some guidance when designing transfers for an integrated system. The limitations women face during their travels can be alleviated by implementing a PT system that is designed to meet their needs more closely.}

Zoning data were compiled for 3914 jurisdictions covering 45.45\% of the U.S. population located in 471 of the most populous U.S. counties and 2 consolidated cities located in 48 states and the District of Columbia. (Sensitivity analyses also captured unincorporated areas which, with the municipalities, collectively covered \textasciitilde 72\% of the U.S. population). Zoning codes were obtained and evaluated to assess the pedestrian-orientation of the zoning codes. Public transit use, active travel to work, median household income, and poverty data were obtained for all study jurisdictions from the 2010-2014 American Community Survey estimates. Associations were examined through multivariate regression models, controlling for community sociodemographics, clustered on county, with robust standard errors. The authors found that certain pedestrian-oriented zoning provisions (e.g., crosswalks, bike-pedestrian connectivity, street connectivity, bike lanes, bike parking, and more zoning provisions) were associated with reduced income and/or poverty disparities in rates of public transit use and active travel to work. Findings from this study can help to inform cross-sectoral collaborations between the public health, planning, and transportation fields regarding zoning for pedestrian-orientation and active travel.}

London Transport Planning is undertaking research to identify the relationship between public transport accessibility and social exclusion in London, and in particular the extent to which Londoners living in areas with high levels of social exclusion are able to access key activities. For most of London, lack of public transport services is unlikely to be the dominant factor in constraining the mobility of socially excluded people, and research by Birkbeck and Kings Colleges of the University of London has identified the processes that constrain access to key activities by socially excluded people. These include the nature of: (1) the time space budget within households, for example, the extent to which a person's daily activities and social relationships constrain their travel; (2) the time-space organisation of the activities that people are seeking to access; and (3) the transport system in terms of cost, accessibility, personal security and public space. Research is planned to identify: (1) how the processes listed above interact with the characteristics of the individual, e.g. age, gender, ethnic origin and culture; (2) the daily activity and travel patterns of socially excluded households particularly how these differ from those of other households; and (3) the development of measures and indicators to assess the effectiveness of transport policies and schemes in meeting the mobility needs of socially excluded people.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to optimize the service area of playgrounds in the case of Adana, Turkey. Additionally, this study aimed to identify location and planning principles that can provide an optimum level of playground utilization. The methodology of study comprises four stages. First, the main optimized standards of area size, children's population, and maximum distance were determined through literature searches and expert views. Second, the quantitative data of optimized standards were determined and evaluated. Third, the optimized service areas for each playground were calculated. Finally, the results were mapped using GIS-based network analysis. The main conclusions of the study are as follows: (a) the improvement area size is the most difficult criterion to meet in compact urban areas, (b) there is no playground that has a suitable area size to serve the population, and (c) playgrounds are not equally distributed in the study area. In line with the study's results, deficiencies in planning strategies and legal regulation can be remedied in accordance with the investigation of national and international scientific studies and the cooperation of the municipal and experts, including urban planners, landscape architects, and architects.},

Transportation performance measures examined included job accessibility, trip duration, trip distance, mode share, and vehicle miles traveled. The model evaluated changes in these indicators for disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities under scenarios when AVs were primarily single-occupancy or high-occupancy, and according to whether transit agencies responded to AVs by maintaining the status quo, removing low-performing routes, or applying AV technology to transit vehicles. Across the performance measures, the high-occupancy AV and enhanced transit scenarios provided an equity benefit, either mitigating an existing gap in outcomes between demographic groups or reducing the extent to which that gap was expanded.}

This ranged from 1.6 to 2.0 km for a single trip, and 3.4 to 4.7 km for a trip chain. Car trips that did not exceed the distance threshold were regarded as short trips. The study found that 7\% of all car trips were short enough to be walked, and 11\% of participants reported at least one short trip on the survey day either as a driver or passenger. Short car trips were more likely to be made by middle-to-older aged adults, women, those who were unemployed, those who had children in the household, those living in the middle-to-most disadvantaged areas, and those living in higher population density areas. The findings suggest a potential for some car trips to be converted into walking among some population groups in Australia. Initiatives to replace short car trips with walking may be particularly effective in higher density areas where local destinations are within a walking distance. Barriers that discourage walking will need to be addressed to facilitate walking trips among middle-to-older adults and in disadvantaged areas.}

  abstract = {Background: Patient choice and access to health care is compromised by many barriers including travel distance. Individuals with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can seek free specialist care in Britain, without a referral, providing flexible access to care services. Willingness to travel beyond local services for preferred care has funding and service implications. Data from an enhanced HIV surveillance system were used to explore geodemographic and clinical factors associated with accessing treatment services.Methods: We extracted data on the location, type and frequency of care services utilized by HIV positive persons (n = 3983) accessing treatment in north west England between January 1(st) 2005 and June 30(th) 2006. Individuals were allocated a deprivation score and grouped by urban/rural residence, and distance to care services was calculated. Analysis identified independent predictors of distance travelled (general linear modelling) and, for those bypassing their nearest clinic, the probability of accessing a specialist service (logistic regression, SPSS ver 14). Inter-relationships between variables and distance travelled were visualised using detrended correspondence analysis (PC-ORD ver 4.1).Results: HIV infected persons travelled an average of 4.8 km (95\% confidence intervals (CI) 4.6-4.9) per trip and had on average 6 visits ( 95\% CI 5.9-6.2) annually for care. Longer trips were made by males ( 4.8 km vs 4.5 km), white people (6.2 km), the young ({$>$}15 years, 6.8 km) and elderly (60+ years, 6.3 km), those on multiple therapy (5.3 km vs 4.0 km), and the more affluent living in rural areas (16.1 km, P {$<$} 0.05). Half the individuals bypassed their nearest clinic to visit a more distant facility, and this was associated with being aged under 20 years, multiple therapy, being a male infected by sex between men, relative wealth, and living in rural areas (P {$<$} 0.05). Of those bypassing local facilities, poorer people were more likely to access a specialist centre but did not have as far to travel to do so (3.6 km) compared to those from less deprived areas (8.6 km).Conclusion: Distance travelled, and type of HIV services used, were associated with socioeconomic status, even after accounting for ethnicity, route of infection and age. Thus despite offering an 'equitable' service, travel costs may advantage those with higher income.},

  abstract = {Home-to-school routes are very sensitive areas: they represent, for children, a learning tool for their everyday activities, but if poorly designed, maintained and equipped they can expose them to traffic risks. Sidewalks’ inappropriate level of service and poor maintenance, especially, are main factors contributing to walking unsuitability, thus to poor comfort and safety levels for young pedestrians, and more in general for all the vulnerable non-motorized road users. This paper deals with a methodology specifically developed to highlight the quality of the urban environment where the home-to-school routes are located, according to four main criteria: wellbeing, usage, appearance, and safety and security. Each criterion is associated with a checklist including the most relevant features to assess, with a focus on maintenance as a key parameter to create safe and comfortable routes to school. An application, a case study in Rome, where the lack of regular maintenance results into a network of unsafe sidewalks, is also presented, analyzing three different areas where a number of schools are located. Detours when approaching school premises were surveyed, due to the levels of distresses and linked to the poor comfort and safety levels. As the mutual influence of built environment over road safety and maintenance requirements for home-to-school paths is not largely investigated thus far, the paper’s goal is to provide advanced knowledge for studies and applications further afield.}

This paper analyzes how the spatial accessibility to local public services is distributed equitably among different social and economic groups in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (MR), Chile. To accomplish this objective, I use accessibility measures to local public services such as transportation, public education, healthcare, kindergartens, parks, fire and police stations, cultural infrastructure, and information about housing prices and exempted housing units from local taxes by block, as well as quantile regressions and bivariate Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). The main results confirm the accessibility to local public services is unequally distributed among residents. However, it affects more low-income groups who are suffering from significant deficits in the provision of local public services. In this scenario, poor residents face a double disadvantage due to their social exclusion from urban systems and their limited access to essential services such as education, healthcare, or transportation. In particular, I found that social residential segregation might be reinforced by insufficient access to local infrastructure that the most impoverished population should assume.}

However, disabled people in the UK have a lower propensity to cycle than the general population. This is often assumed to reflect lower levels of interest and reduced capability to cycle, although there is little reported evidence on the actual cycling experiences of disabled people. This study contributes to knowledge in the field by exploring the infrastructural and environmental challenges negotiated by a group of disabled people who currently cycle and utilise the cycle network in Swindon a typical large town in the UK.Methods: Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 disabled cyclists and support workers from an inclusive cycling centre. Some participant also chose to take part in a 'ride-along' interview to complement participants' own accounts with observational data.Results: Participants who used adapted cycles experienced the greatest difficulties in using the cycle network and generally considered their cycles unsuitable for transportation purposes. This was due to both physical obstructions and a requirement to 'dismount' in pedestrianised areas where cycling is prohibited. Compared with adapted cycle-users, participants with 'invisible disabilities' using standard cycles experienced a greater sense of vulnerability when cycling in motor traffic, as drivers exhibited less care around them. Financial and social barriers to cycling also emerged strongly in participants' accounts.Conclusions: Many challenges faced by disabled cyclists reflect those experienced by non-disabled cyclists, but barriers are much more profound for disabled people. Public authorities need to improve the inclusivity of cycling in towns through measures such as: creating pathways to help more disabled people progress from learning to cycle to cycling independently; regular audits of the network using an adapted cycle; and legally recognising cycles as mobility aids.},

However, under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Neighborhood Development (LEED ND) rating system, the infrastructure requirements of this built typology can preclude it from achieving sustainability certification. LEED ND is the most established certification system for projects at the district scale that seek economic development without the depletion of natural, cultural, and social surroundings. In 2015, Los Angeles Union Station, in California, through its master plan, LAUSMP, became the first transit hub to pursue LEED ND certification. Using evidence from LAUSMP, this paper outlines the inherent advantages, existing barriers, and needed expansions to achieve compatibility between transit center design and LEED ND. This paper also suggests updated metrics for connectivity and walkability to recognize linkages that occur above and below the ground plane, inclusion of incentives for carbon emissions reduction and air quality monitoring, and expanded exemptions for transit infrastructure from density and tree-lined street calculations. The paper proposes a revised version of the LEED ND rating system to create a standardized tool with which to measure sustainability across transit hubs.}

  abstract = {As healthcare is a right in Canada, analyzing the distribution of spatial access to medical consultations, which are crucial for the prevention, diagnosis, and early treatment of illnesses, is fundamental to understanding health equity. Spatial accessibility can influence whether individuals can reasonably reach the services they seek. However, as an indicator of potential access, it does not guarantee realized access because of predisposing and need factors. This study examines the relationship between spatial accessibility to hospitals and the likelihood of consulting with a healthcare professional at a hospital in eight Canadian metropolitan regions while controlling for individual characteristics through multilevel regression modeling. Spatial accessibility was computed using the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method. Self-reported consultations and socio-demographic characteristics were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey. We found that the likelihood of consultations differed between genders (female OR: 1.133, CI: 1.023-1.255; compared with male) and followed a positive household income gradient (high-income OR: 1.236, CI: 1.094-1.397; middle-income OR: 1.039, CI: 0.922-1.172; compared with low-income), but is not influenced by age. Living in areas with higher spatial accessibility was positively linked to consultations (OR: 1.014, CI: 1.000-1.028), even after controlling for perceived health (OR: 0.540, CI: 0.471-0.621), chronic conditions (OR: 1.738, CI: 1.587-1.904), and having a regular doctor (OR: 1.313, CI: 1.187-1.452). Policies that may improve spatial accessibility to healthcare services through increasing supply, managing demand, and enhancing level of public transport service should be considered to improve individuals' ability to consult healthcare professionals, potentially leading to better health outcomes.},

Its principal aim is to improve on current research methods in this field. Existing approaches derive associations between TD and its impacts through simple comparative methods, through qualitative methods and using limited and prescriptive definitions of SE. The new method draws from an interview questionnaire measuring TD through self-reported difficulties with transport. A principal components analysis of responses identifies four statistically significant sub-scales (transit disadvantage, transport disadvantage, vulnerable/impaired and rely on others). SE is represented in five dimensions including income, unemployment, political engagement, participation in activities and social support networks. Well-being adopts standard psychological measures-'Satisfaction With Life Scale' (SWLS), 'Positive Affect' (PA) and 'Negative Affect' (NA). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to model links between TD, SE and WB. A hypothesised model proposed negative associations between SE and WB and between TD and WB and a positive association between TD and SE. Modelling results showed that scales used to measure TD, SE and WB were all statistically related to their underlying concepts. Modelling of the hypothesised links between constructs was generally favourable with a good statistical fit. However the relationship between TD and WB was not significant. An exploratory analysis supported the hypothesis that this was caused by high reported travel difficulties for both highly mobile and less mobile people. A revised theoretical model explored the theory that feelings of isolation due to time poverty might be mediating the TD-WB link. SEM analysis of the revised model confirmed a good model fit with statistically significant measures between TD, time poverty and WB. Time poverty was not found to be associated with social exclusion. The final model suggested that TD is positively associated with SE with a measured strength of .27. SE is strongly negatively associated with WB (-.87). TD is positively associated with time poverty (.19) while time poverty is negatively associated with well-being (-.14). Areas for future research are identified.}

Many of the efforts to increase accessibility are directed at minimizing this gap, both horizontally and vertically. There is a general idea of the widths and heights that are completely unacceptable (15 cm x 15 cm being too much, for example), but there is much less of an idea of what type of gap is acceptable without aids such as lifts and ramps. It is essential to know how much can be achieved by narrowing the gap; that is, which types of disability and mobility girls will be accommodated, and how many disabled will benefit from a specific reduction of the gap. At the request of the Dutch National Office for Accessibility, the Delft University of Technology performed laboratory experiments to gain quantitative insights into this topic. For these experiments, a standard platform was built in a laboratory hall. A number of platforms representing public transport vehicles were placed along this pier. These were positioned at different combinations of horizontal and vertical distances. Persons with physical disabilities were invited to test the different gaps. In the analysis of the testing results, the relation between disability, mobility aid, and gap size was investigated. The results of the study revealed that the 2-cm x 2-cm gap was hardly a problem, whereas the 10 cm x 10 cm gap constituted a serious problem for more than half of the participants. Access for nearly all requires a gap size no larger than 5 cm x 2 cm. Especially in bus transport, this is hardly feasible. Therefore, vehicles will need ramps as a standard provision.}

In this exploratory study, a Delphi technique with health experts, researchers, drivers and funding agencies developed an instrument to examine the barriers and benefits of access to private modified vehicles for PWD. An online survey was completed by 287 drivers and carers to report on barriers to private modified vehicles, whilst a sub-set of 190 drivers with access to a private modified vehicle reported on experientially derived benefits. A factor analytic approach identified how financial and informational barriers vary with respect to several characteristics including disability type and level of support needs. Factors relating to independence, social and recreational benefits are perceived as more valued experientially derived benefits relative to benefits relating to employability and ability to enjoy downtime. Benefits in the form of independence are greater among drivers and owners, those with an acquired condition, less complex mobility and everyday support needs, whilst little difference emerged in terms of the social and downtime benefits. The findings inform policy development and funding opportunities to provide insight and evidence into the barriers, but also benefits and variation in private transport needs among PWD.},

Next, we focus on the outliers that escape this trade-off and we develop a methodology to combine their respective levels of accessibility and air pollution into a 'desirability' indicator. Finally, we analyse the distribution of the most and the least desirable neighbourhoods across the city: while we observe flagrant patterns of inequality, these do not reflect the socio-economic structure of the region, in apparent contrast with the literature on transport justice and environmental justice. The results show how positive and negative socio-ecological externalities can be two sides of the same agglomeration coin. The methodology proves to be relevant to further comparative research and policy making concerned with promoting a balanced progress of social, economic and environmental priorities.},

  abstract = {The problem of employment access for the urban poor is often articulated across the urban-suburban divide in metropolitan areas, such that job opportunities concentrate in suburban areas, at a distance from areas of concentrated, racialized poverty in the inner city. The lack of public transit options that reasonably connect urban workers to suburban job opportunities only furthers this problem. However, transportation scholars have noted that a substantial population of the urban poor take this "reverse" commute. While these studies have grown knowledge on the characteristics of the reverse commuting population and their journey to work, they do not address, to the same extent, the demographic characteristics where reverse commuters live in the city and where they work in the suburbs. To learn more about the equity issues in the reverse commuting problem, this paper uses cluster analysis to develop typologies of commutes based on differences in key socio-demographic indicators between home (origin) and work (destination) geographies. This paper analyzes how commute patterns (infra-urban, suburb-city, etc.) and the number of jobs nested within these commute patterns, concentrate across socio-demographically defined commute typologies. Focus is given to how reverse commutes are distributed across these typologies. Reverse commutes constitute approximately 10\% of all commutes in our sample and 10\% of all primary jobs (the job that provides a worker the most income of all of their jobs) in the sample are accessed via reverse commute. The paper concludes with a number of transportation and social policy interventions that address issues facing particularly low-income, minority, reverse commuting workers. In light of the literature on metropolitan fragmentation, we recommend redistributive policies that build suburban, municipal accountability to urban, low-income reverse commuters.},

This article aims to identify and analyze arrangements for providing specialized care in the Brazilian remote rural municipalities (RRMs).Methods: This is a multiple-case qualitative case study developed in seven RRMs located in the Brazilian semi-arid region. Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted with the public health system managers, complemented by analysis of secondary data from national health information systems. Thematic content analysis was guided by the Integrated Health Service Network attributes related to the provision of specialized care.Results: Socioeconomic indicators and indicators of availability and accessibility to health services express the context of greater vulnerability of RRM and their respective health regions when compared to states and the country. The analyzed cases do not come close to the RISS constitutive attributes. Various arrangements for the provision and financing of specialized care in the RRM were identified: public provision through an agreement between managers in the health region, health consortia, public provision in the municipality itself or neighboring municipalities, provision in private health services through direct purchase (out-of-pocket), and telehealth (very incipient). Such arrangements were unable to respond quantitatively and qualitatively to the demand for specialized care. Providing timely specialized care in an adequate place is not achieved, resulting in a fragmented, low-resolution model. The fragility of regionalized networks, aggravated by underfunding of the Brazilian Unified Health System, insufficient logistical support, and computerization of health services, contributes to care gaps and unacceptably long travel times for common specialized procedures, with more severe effects for people residing in the rural areas of the municipalities.Conclusion: Brazil's disorganization or lack of a systemic response based on regionalized health networks generates several care improvisations. The less structured the RISS, the more informal arrangements are made, with gains for the private sector to the detriment of public health system users.}

The most common accessibility metric, the cumulative opportunity measure, is often computed as the number of jobs that can be reached within a certain time frame. Aggregating all jobs, however, often inflates the opportunities that can be reached by socially vulnerable residents, which could feed into and/or generate inadequate policy decisions. This study therefore develops the measure of accessibility to low-income jobs for vulnerable residents by public transport, specifically taking into account realized travel times by these vulnerable individuals. This fine-grained measure, computed across 11 major Canadian cities, is a modified place-based accessibility metric that incorporates facets of person-based metrics, allowing planners and policy makers to propose more targeted interventions to improve the quality of life of their cities' most vulnerable populations. The study further allows for direct comparisons between the impacts of variation in accessibility levels between different regions to help create best practices in land use and transport planning.}

Well-being was also measured adopting standard psychological measures of 'Satisfaction with Life', 'Personal Well-being Index,' 'Positive Affect' and 'Negative Affect'.A factor analysis of self-reported transport difficulties identified four statistically significant sub-scales ('transport disadvantage', 'transit disadvantage', 'Vulnerable/Impaired' and 'rely on others') which together account for 57\% of the variance in the responses.Analysis established that those with high self-reported transport problems were more likely to be located in fringe and remote parts of the city and lived in areas where it was not possible to walk to a local shop. However all groups made an average number of trips per day (except the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' group which make fewer trips) suggesting that self-reported transport disadvantage is unrelated to realised mobility. Analysis further established that only the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' group was associated with social exclusion and that they also had the lowest values of well-being compared to other groups.Overall findings confirm the methodological concerns associated with the use of self-reported measures of transport problems as a basis for defining transport disadvantage. The majority of those with high self-reported transport problems did not travel less than the survey sample as a whole and they were not associated with social exclusion. However the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' group was the exception, displaying a significantly higher association with social exclusion and lower well-being.The findings suggest which aspects of transport disadvantage are likely to be of greater concern for social policy. A concentration of research and policy on issues and social groups associated with the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' factor would be more effective in reducing social exclusion. Transport problems associated with this group including physical access to transport, knowing where to go and feeling safe from theft or attack when travelling may deserve higher priorities for attention. In addition those associated with the 'Vulnerable/Impaired' factor including older retired females and those who are more likely to be looking after someone with an illness or disability are clearly a high risk group and should warrant positive discrimination in transport and social policy.

   abstract = {Equity has been a major concern of public transport provision and is required by legislation in many countries. Several approaches measure equity in transit supply however none produce a simple system-wide measure of equity performance. A new approach is presented using Lorenz curves to measure the relative supply of transit to the population. Gini coefficients provide a single measure of overall equity using this method. A system-wide assessment of overall transit supply to the population in Melbourne. Australia shows that 70% of the population shares only 19% of the supply (Gini coefficient = .68). When employment is also taken into account, the situation is not much different; 70% of jobs and population share 23% of service (G = .62). In order to gain some understanding of vertical equity, the transit supply was compared between different age, income and vehicle ownership groups. There is some evidence of higher supply for youth and low-income groups in inner Melbourne, and in all parts of Melbourne no-vehicle households lived in areas of higher transit supply. Overall it is unclear how "fair" these distributions are compared to equity in other cities since this is the first time this method has been undertaken. Projects using similar approaches should provide a good basis for establishing comparative equity between cities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Walking is one of the most commonly promoted traveling methods and is garnering increasing attention. Many indices/scores have been developed by scholars to measure the walkability in a local community. However, most existing walking indices/scores involve urban planning-oriented, local service-oriented, regional accessibility-oriented, and physical activity-oriented walkability assessments. Since shopping and dining are two major leisure activities in our daily lives, more attention should be given to the shopping or dining-oriented walking environment. Therefore, we developed two additional walking indices that focus on shopping or dining. The point of interest (POI), vegetation coverage, water coverage, distance to bus/subway station, and land surface temperature were employed to construct walking indices based on 50-m street segments. Then, walking index values were categorized into seven recommendation levels. The field verification illustrates that the proposed walking indices can accurately represent the walking environment for shopping and dining. The results in this study could provide references for citizens seeking to engage in activities of shopping and dining with a good walking environment.}

This paper is based on the data from a single survey-carried out in two European cities (Madrid and Lisbon)-of regular private vehicle users that use public transport at least occasionally. The questionnaire gathers information about 14 attributes of service quality, four indicators for satisfaction and four indicators for behavioral intentions; as well as several sociodemographic variables that are used in the models (household location, gender, age, education, dependent members in the family and income). The study uses confirmatory factor analysis to identify the most important service quality attributes for the car users; structural equation modeling for investigating the relationships among the three factors; and multi-group analysis (MGA) and a multiple-indicator and multiple-causes (MIMIC) approach to identify heterogeneity in the models because of geographical context or sociodemographic characteristics. Regular private vehicle users in both cities agree that punctuality, frequency, information and intermodality are among the five most important service quality attributes. Residents in Madrid also emphasize speed, while service hours would be a priority in Lisbon. The models for both cities agree on a complete mediator role of satisfaction between service quality and behavioral intentions. The MGA and MIMIC approaches show that the models do not present important differences tied to the sociodemographic characteristics, although differences are identified between Madrid and Lisbon. The MIMIC approach identified differences associated with city, household location and education for the pooled data; while household location, age and education were significant in Lisbon.}

J Transp Eng 135(8):506–515, 2009). Success of travel behavior studies is mostly dependent on healthy data collection. Aim of this paper, is to evaluate and suggest the most suitable database development approach and research strategies which can be adopted for travel behavior studies especially in context of Indian metro cities. It also presents entire survey design procedure adopted for travel mode shift study along with researchers’ experience in execution of survey and difficulties faced by field teams. Three level filtration processes are adopted for selection of variables for development of mode shift models. Initially the least important variables were omitted based on variable ranking results. Top ranked seven variables are identified for final survey design, out of which travel time (including transit access time, waiting time and in-vehicle time), travel cost and number of transfers are directly measurable variables while comfort, convenience, safety and security are latent variables. The latent variables are measured using psychometric scale constructed from various latent variable indicators and then converted into latent classes using principal component analysis. Research instrument developed and adopted for the present study was tested through pilot survey and corrected as per data compatibility requirement. Finally 1017 valid responses out of 1500 distributed questionnaires are analyzed to evaluate the effects of enhanced level of hypothetical public transport services on travel mode shift behavior through development of binary logistic regression models. Changes in the model performance with inclusion of latent classes are also evaluated using various statistical tools. This paper includes original work based on primary data from a field survey, findings of which are expected to provide a better understanding of entire database development process and effect of different variables on mode shift behavior in context of Indian metropolitan area.}

In this case study, we investigate differentials in accessibility to stations using a balanced floating catchment area approach and compare accessibility with and without the equity stations. We analyze population interpolated to small cells to better reflect walking to a station and conduct a sensitivity analysis at several walking time thresholds. We then reaggregate the estimated accessibility by income groups for further analysis. Our findings indicate that equity stations increased accessibility for the serviced population at every threshold examined, but the increase was relatively modest especially for population in the bottom 20\% of median total household income.},

Travel surveys can reveal the nature and distribution of bicycling trips, but perceptions and behaviours of bicyclists are better understood through qualitative methods. In particular, developing cycling cities are unique settings to examine how the built environment supports bicycling as changes are made to increase bicycling levels. Through semi-structured interviews, this research explores the case of Hamilton, Ontario and the factors that influence route choice from the perspective of regular bicyclists. Major themes were identified using thematic analysis: (i) exclusion from road space; (ii) infrastructure; and (iii) streetscape. Bicyclists highly value infrastructure and seek routes that minimize interactions with cars, while avoiding many arterial roads that prioritize motorists. Routes that appear to be more human-oriented or that have nature are also attractive. Many regular bicyclists report that current bicycle infrastructure does not meet their preferences. Despite building nearly half of the planned infrastructure network, our findings suggest the built environment is not perceived to be oriented to bicycling. This study provides policy and practice recommendations for developing cycling cities in North America as they transition towards established cycling cities.},

   abstract = {Background: Children&rsquo;s access to non-school destinations is important for their well-being, but this has been overlooked in transport planning. Research on children&rsquo;s access to non-school destinations is growing, and there is a need for a comprehensive overview, examining both quantitative and qualitative studies, of the existing evidence on places that children access by active or independent travel. Objectives: Identify and summarize quantitative and qualitative research on the topic of active or independent travel to non-school destinations for elementary aged children (6 to 13 years old). Methods: Papers published in English between 1980 and July 2021 were sourced from: (i) Web of Science Core Collection; (ii) PubMed; and (iii) APA PsycInfo. Three relevant journals related to children and transport were hand searched: (i) Children&rsquo;s Geographies; (ii) Journal of Transport & Health; and (iii) Journal of Transport Geography. The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles published in English between 1980 and July 2021. Covidence, an online software platform for systematic reviews, was used to organize articles during the title and abstract screening stage. PRISMA-Scr is applied for reporting. Results: 27 papers were retained from an initial 1293 identified peer-reviewed articles. The results reveal that children in different geographies travel unsupervised or by active modes to places that support different domains of their well-being such as a friend or relative&rsquo;s home, local parks or green spaces, recreational facilities, and different retail locations (e.g., restaurants). There is evidence that children&rsquo;s ability to reach certain places is constrained, likely due to safety concerns or environmental barriers. Conclusions: Research on children&rsquo;s diverse destinations is relatively limited as compared to trips to school. Various methodologies have been applied and can be combined to completement each other such as objective GPS tracking and subjective surveys on places children would go if they were available. Future research should clearly report and discuss the non-school destinations that children access to better inform transport planning and policy for all aspects of children&rsquo;s lives.},

However, used extensively, standard GIS software does not have direct capabilities to integrate transit schedules into multimodal networks and measure space-time-based accessibility. This has caused authors to either simplify travel time elements or develop tools to overcome these challenges. In this paper we aim to describe and implement a method that enables integrating time-table data from a travel planner into a multimodal network model using simple SQL (structured query language) programming and standard GIS. The method presented here integrates all parts of travelling by public transportation from individual home addresses to all reachable transit stops within different travel time thresholds. The method is used successfully to create a multimodal travel-time network model of the Capital Region of Denmark comprising bus, train, light rail, metro, and ferry as well as integrating walking or cycling to stops. Here, the individual accessibility is defined as accessibility areas. The accessibility areas are created at morning rush hour for a study population of 29 447 individuals and a few examples of accessibility areas are presented. The results show a big difference in individual public transportation accessibility in the region. In addition, how the transit network is accessed, whether it is at the nearest stop or at all stops within 1 km walking distance or 3 km cycling distance, leads to very different accessibility areas.}

Few studies to date have quantitatively assessed intersections of multiple urban environmental factors and their distribution across levels of deprivation.Objectives: To explore the spatial patterns of urban environmental exposures within three large Canadian cities, assess how exposures are distributed across socio-economic deprivation gradients, and identify clusters of favourable or unfavourable environmental characteristics.Methods: We indexed nationally standardized estimates of active living friendliness (i.e. "walkability"), NO2 air pollution, and greenness to 6-digit postal codes within the cities of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. We compared the distribution of within-city exposure tertiles across quintiles of material deprivation. Tertiles of each exposure were then overlaid with each other in order to identify potentially favorable (high walkability, low NO2, high greenness) and unfavorable (low walkability, high NO2, and low greenness) environments.Results: In all three cities, high walkability was more common in least deprived areas and less prevalent in highly deprived areas. We also generally saw a greater prevalence of postal codes with high vegetation indices and low NO2 in areas with low deprivation, and a lower greenness prevalence and higher NO2 concentrations in highly deprived areas, suggesting environmental inequity is occurring. Our study showed that relatively few postal codes were simultaneously characterized by desirable or undesirable walkability, NO2 and greenness tertiles.Discussion: Spatial analyses of multiple standardized urban environmental factors such as the ones presented in this manuscript can help refine municipal investments and policy priorities. This study illustrates a methodology to prioritize areas for interventions that increase active living and exposure to urban vegetation, as well as lower air pollution. Our results also highlight the importance of considering the intersections between the built environment and socio-economic status in city planning and urban public health decision-making.},

The main novelty of our work is that this analysis not only includes the registered resident population, but also incorporates the population that temporarily inhabits the municipality (tourists). The results of the study firstly permit the detection of unequal spatial accessibility and coverage in terms of public transport in the municipality, with significant differences between central neighbourhoods and peripheral urban areas of lower population density.

The first component of the proposed framework includes a percolation simulation model capable of integrating the road network disruption probability into the flood propagation and encapsulates the road network's access to critical facilities (i.e., healthcare facilities). The discovered spatial reach of an areas' physical vulnerability dependence is 9 miles. Besides, physical disruptions in road networks and loss of access to emergency services (such as healthcare) have varying impacts on different sub-populations. To consider this aspect, the second component of the proposed framework involves a disruption tolerance index (DTI) to examine communities' tolerance towards access disruption to healthcare facilities in the face of the flooding. The proposed framework recognizes the importance of both infrastructure and human perspective of the vulnerability assessment and is tested using empirical data from Harris County, Texas, in the case of road network disruptions due to fluvial flooding. Houston, the fourth-largest city in the United States, is within Harris County. Integrated spatial analysis result reveals different spatial clusters of vulnerability across the study region and provides important insights regarding the critical infrastructure protection prioritization and hazard mitigation planning. The spatial clusters also unveil the existence of a homogeneous spatial pattern where similar vulnerable areas stay together. The proposed framework could be adopted by other cities and different critical facilities to enable decision-makers, infrastructure managers, and city planners to better evaluate their community vulnerability.},

Driving, being driven by a spouse/partner and taking public transport were independently associated with better indicators of social participation and psychosocial wellbeing versus relying on lifts from family/friends. Non-drivers and less frequent drivers had poorer outcomes versus current drivers. These results highlight the importance of being able to travel independently whether by car or public transport. Opportunities to support this should be considered when planning future transport needs of ageing populations. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}

We call the measure Isolation and anticipate it will be useful as an alternative to commonly used rural classification schemes (e.g., the Census Bureau's measure). Following the best known standards for measuring rurality, it captures the trade-off between access to resource-rich, high-population-density areas and the cost of travel to those areas; thus even intrinsically low-resource areas may have high access to nearby resources. Validity was tested with proxies such as distance to hospitals, physician availability, and access to high quality food. The Isolation scale demonstrated good construct validity (i.e., both convergent and criterion validity). Fit statistics indicated that, compared to other commonly-used urban/rural definitions, the Isolation scale was the best overall measure when predicting several proxies for rurality, even when categorized. We also show that the measure does a substantially better job at explaining national health outcome data at the state level. This new continuous Isolation scale shows considerable promise for improving our conceptualization, theorization, and measurement of the features of rurality that are pertinent to rural health disparities research, and can also be useful to policy makers who may find value in using isolation thresholds that are most relevant to their policy planning needs.},

  abstract = {Cycling is increasingly prioritized as a mode of transport with multiple socio-economic, environmental, and health benefits. However, the benefits associated with cycling are not always equitably distributed throughout society, meaning that some people (e.g. people with low incomes, immigrants and people of colour, women, and seniors) may not have access to safe and convenient spaces in which to cycle, with infrastructure inadequately accommodating the varying needs of all members of society. Based on a review of academic literature, as well as a critical review of city-level transport plans in Canada, we evaluate if and how transport plans in Canada are addressing equity, as well as the ways in which planning practice can more effectively provide for it. Findings from the review of Canadian transport plans revealed four key themes related to how plans can, and do currently address equity, including (1) socio-spatial network analysis (2) consideration of equity in projects and priorities, (3) equity-oriented funding mechanisms, (4) inclusive design and safety. While some plans were found to have addressed equity, many did not, or did so to a limited and ineffective way. As per the findings from the academic literature, many opportunities exist to advance the pursuit of cycling equity, including for example, the utili­ zation of appropriate and effective methods of analysis, as well as locally tailored engagement and decisionmaking processes that effectively address the needs and concerns of local residents, particularly those who are most disadvantaged.},

A laboratory study was conducted using a static full-scale mock-up of a low-floor bus. Users of wheeled mobility devices (n=48) and walking aids (n=22), and visually impaired (n=17) and able-bodied (n=17) users evaluated three bus layout configurations at two PLF levels yielding information on B-D performance.         Statistical regression models of B-D times helped quantify relative contributions of layout, PLF, and user characteristics viz., impairment type, power grip strength, and speed of ambulation or wheelchair propulsion. Wheeled mobility device users, and individuals with lower grip strength and slower speed were impacted greater by vehicle design resulting in increased dwell time.         To ensure safe, efficient and equitable access to the diverse spectrum of transit riders, transit system design needs approaches that transcend existing minimum federal accessibility design standards. This study improves our understanding of the relationship between vehicle design and the functional abilities of users. The need for research and design to achieve inclusive and space- and time-efficient transit systems is discussed.},

   abstract = {Background Much of the research on the detrimental effects of inequality on well-being is based on cross-sectional surveys, which may have over- or under-estimated the relationship between income inequality and well-being. Moreover, the vast majority of the work comes from Western industrialized contexts but it is not known to what extent the same pattern holds in non-Western developing countries. Objective The current research aims to address these two issues by investigating the longitudinal effects of income inequality on well-being in China. Method We used the China Family Panel Studies dataset in 2010–2014. Our study includes a representative sample of 29,331 residents from 20 provinces in China. The participants completed measures of well-being, including subjective well-being and psychological distress. We examined whether provincial-level income inequality in 2010 predicted individual-level well-being in 2014. Results Multilevel analyses showed that residents in more unequal provinces had lower subjective well-being and greater psychological distress. The patterns still held, after controlling for baseline well-being and a number of covariates, including age, gender, education, income, ethnicity, marital status, and urban/rural residence. The effects of inequality on well-being differed across socioeconomic groups. Conclusion Findings suggest that income inequality has long-term adverse consequences on well-being in a non-Western developing society. Furthermore, its effects are moderated by financial wealth.},

  abstract = {Background: Few studies have used GPS data to analyze the relationship between Walk Score, transportation choice and walking. Additionally, the influence of Walk Score is understudied using trips rather than individuals as statistical units. The purpose of this study is to examine associations at the trip level between Walk Score, transportation mode choice, and walking among Paris adults who were tracked with GPS receivers and accelerometers in the RECORD GPS Study. Methods: In the RECORD GPS Study, 227 participants were tracked during seven days with GPS receivers and accelerometers. Participants were also surveyed with a GPS-based web mapping application on their activities and transportation modes for all trips (6969 trips). Walk Score, which calculates neighborhood walkability, was assessed for each origin and destination of every trip. Multilevel logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to estimate associations between Walk Score and walking in the trip or accelerometry-assessed number of steps for each trip, after adjustment for individual/neighborhood characteristics. Results: The mean overall Walk Scores for trip origins were 87.1 (SD = 14.4) and for trip destinations 87.1 (SD = 14.5). In adjusted trip-level associations between Walk Score and walking only in the trip, we found that a walkable neighborhood in the trip origin and trip destination was associated with increased odds of walking in the trip assessed in the survey. The odds of only walking in the trip were 3.48 (95\% CI: 2.73 to 4.44) times higher when the Walk Score for the trip origin was "Walker's Paradise" compared to less walkable neighborhoods (Very/Car-Dependent or Somewhat Walkable), with an identical independent effect of trip destination Walk Score on walking. The number of steps per 10 min (as assessed with accelerometry) was cumulatively higher for trips both originating and ending in walkable neighborhoods (i.e., "Very Walkable"). Conclusions: Walkable neighborhoods were associated with increases in walking among adults in Paris, as documented at the trip level. Creating walkable neighborhoods (through neighborhood design increased commercial activity) may increase walking trips and, therefore, could be a relevant health promotion strategy to increase physical activity.}

Therefore, we developed a heuristic and data-miningbased method to weigh both Demand And/oR Equity (DARE) in the station distribution and allocation process of planning bike-sharing. Equity is measured using a deprivation index and the potential demand is estimated using structural equation models via the built and social environment. The DARE method was applied first to the BSS service area in Munich, Germany, and then, to the area surrounding Munich, demonstrating the method's transferability. Incorporating equity resulted in disadvantaged areas being better served by bike-sharing stations while favoring ridership (demand) tended to cluster stations in the wealthier city center. This method allows decision-makers to build scenarios for allocating infrastructure based on their desired fairness criterion, and can also be applied to other shared modes or public transport.}

Areas where mainly young Caucasians, highly educated people live, and that have high access to community resources, presented greater access to BSS. Based on the concept of spatial fairness and its subjectivity, we developed a framework for a qualitative and quantitative assessment to help decision-makers and the general public evaluate the allocation of BSS infrastructure. First, from the general concept of justice, we developed our definition of spatial fairness assessment based on the rules of spatial equity, equality, and efficiency. Then, we developed a qualitative and quantitative spatial fairness assessment of BSS. The qualitative assessment aims to understand how underprivileged people perceive the spatial fairness of BSSs taking as case study non-motorized households in Strasbourg feeling socially excluded. The quantitative assessment helps to numerically determine which distribution rule (equity, equality, efficiency) the infrastructure of a BSS follows. This assessment was applied in residential blocks inside the service area of the hybrid BSS in Munich, Germany. We developed a concept of availability as an accessibility indicator. As social indicators, we considered social milieus, access to other opportunities (e.g. health, education), and developed a deprivation index that is a combination of those two. As a result of the qualitative assessment, non-motorized individuals who felt socially excluded were less likely to talk about BSS at all. Furthermore, bicycles' availability in the bike-sharing system in Munich matched the efficiency and equity rule, although lower availability of bikes correlates to residential blocks where traditional-oriented social groups live. Policy makers, stakeholders, urban and transport planners, and the general public have now available 1) the perception of a group of the underprivileged population about BSS, and 2) a quantitative methodology to identify which distribution rule(s) the infrastructure of a BSS follows and which social groups are spatially advantaged or disadvantaged by it. Further research may be oriented to apply the approach in the same city or applying them to more case studies.}

In spite of the developments in better identifying transportation disadvantaged groups, the lack of effective policies resulted in the continuum of the issue as a significant problem. This paper undertakes a pilot case investigation as test bed for a new approach developed to reduce transportation policy shortcomings. The approach, 'disadvantage-impedance index', aims to ease transportation disadvantages by employing representative parameters to measure the differences between policy alternatives run in a simulation environment. Implemented in the Japanese town of Arao, the index uses trip-making behaviour and resident stated preference data. The results of the index reveal that even a slight improvement in accessibility and travel quality indicators makes a significant difference in easing disadvantages. The index, integrated into a four-step model, proves to be highly robust and useful in terms of quick diagnosis in capturing effective actions, and developing potentially efficient policies.

Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.

In addition to the traditional environmental objective, we propose a novel measure to quantify the social performance by using the concepts of Distributive Justice (DJ) and Sustainable Transition (ST) to investigate the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles (AFV). In our context, DJ is defined as fair access to transportation, the latter being a vital means for people to realize their full capabilities in the society. Furthermore, ST measures the social dimension through DJ and the environmental dimension through AFV sales. To model the complex network of relationships characterizing this framework, we use System Dynamics methodology to study the long term impact of considering DJ and ST. Our findings show that policy makers should adjust their targets to consider DJ criteria along with environmental objectives, thus aiming at a sustainable transition. By doing so, they can control and hasten the transition to AFV. Finally, we evaluate the contribution of each policy instrument to guide the policy-making process and catalyze this transition.},

It provides a concrete implementation model for SAVs set to improve equity in accessibility and highlights the need of regulation in order for SAVs to help overcome identified spatial mismatches. Methodology Through the formulation of linear regression models, the relationship between land-use and transportation accessibility (by car and public transport) and socio-economic well-being indicators is tested on district-level in four European cities: Paris, Berlin, London and Vienna. Accessibility data is used to analyse access to points of interest within given timespans by both car and public transport. To measure equity in socio-economic well-being, three district-level proxies are introduced: yearly income, unemployment rate and educational attainment. Results In the cities of Paris, London and Vienna, as well as partially in Berlin, positive effects of educational attainment on accessibility are evidenced. Further, positive effects on accessibility by yearly income are found in Paris and London. Additionally, negative effects of an increased unemployment rate on accessibility are observed in Paris and Vienna. Through the comparison between accessibility by car and public transportation in the districts of the four cities, the potential for SAVs is evidenced. Lastly, on the basis of the findings a 'SAV identification matrix' is created, visualizing the underserved districts in each of the four cities and the need of equity enhancing policy for the introduction of SAVs is emphasized.}

It explains how transit access to jobs drops with network distance from the Central Business District (CBD), ceteris paribus, and introduces the urban space-time structure. This is empirically examined in the 45 most populated American cities. The analysis finds, regardless of the city, transit access declines as one moves out from the center, and in most cities, transit access decays from a surfeit of employment to relative scarcity. In this transition, the transit network acts as a "catalyst" to induce access to CBD employments centralization. The analysis also declares that urban structure defined by transit access is a fluid concept. This changes the traditional urban structure definition as it can make a CBD centric city dispersed and contrariwise. The strength of inverse relationship between the network distance from the center and transit access is a function of the travel-time threshold and follows the law of diminishing returns. The vertex point of the function indicates the absolute maximum CBD centricity. The urban structure, indeed, shifts from CBD decentralized to CBD centralized and begins shifting to CBD decentralized by an increase in the transit travel-time threshold. This is the product of mobility and place, and argues that the transport network has grown by a policy that permits CBD concentration, at least in the short run. While it is not clear, long-term considerations of equity may modify this growth to one of concentrated CBD decentralization. The concentration is typical of the take-off stage of the transport network, and that equalization takes place as the network matures.}

First, to evaluate the energy resilience of 250 blocks of the study area, 28 indicators in four components of urban geometry and morphology, land use, public transportation, and passive design were adopted. Subsequently, using a hybrid factor analysis and analytic network process (F'ANP) model, flexibility, interdependence, coordination capacity, equity, efficiency, self organization, independence, and diversity were determined as the eight underlying energy resilience principles related to the spatial structure of the study area. The composite index results reveal that principles and indicators related to transportation have a more significant role in energy resilience than operational energy related ones. Also, increasing compactness without simultaneous attention to the mass-space ratio and adequate provision of green spaces does not necessarily lead to increased energy resilience and may even detract from resilience. To illustrate the practical implications of the study findings, we recommend action plans that can contribute to enhancing the energy resilience of the study area. The proposed globally applicable framework is expected to give urban planners a better understanding ofurban form and spatial structure implicationsfor energy resilience. It can also inform planning and decision making for achieving urban climate change adaptation and mitigation targets.}

There are several studies focusing on optimal pricing strategies to minimize the congestion level or maximize the revenue of the system. However, with regard to equity issues, benefiting only users with higher value of time is claimed to be the main factor that prevents implementation of such policies in practice. While many studies aimed to tackle the equity issues by certain welfare analyses, most of these studies fail to fully consider realistic features of users' behavior and the uncertainty in link travel times. Given the variability of travel time in real-world networks and the impacts of pricing policies on path travel time distributions, it is important to consider the users' reliability valuations, in addition to their travel time valuations. Thus, the goal in this study is to find an equitable pricing scheme that minimizes the total travel time of auto users in a general bimodal network considering heterogeneous users with different values of time and reliability. A particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to find self-funded and Pareto-improving optimal toll values. A reliability-based user equilibrium algorithm is embedded into this optimization algorithm to assign travelers to the equilibrated paths for different user classes given toll values. The proposed approach is successfully applied to a modified Sioux Falls network to explore impacts of subsidization, congestion level, and considering travel time reliability on the pricing strategy and its effectiveness.}

In calculating public transport affordability, we consider two different criteria based on the "observed mobility" and the "potential mobility". Using household travel survey data, we estimate that on average, observed public transport affordability indexes are below 7\% (6.2\% in Cordoba and 3.8\% in Montevideo). Nonetheless, for the lower quintile, this index reaches 11.7\% in Cordoba and 6.4\% in Montevideo. The observed affordability index is based on the expenditure on observed public transport trips, which does not consider those trips that, even when necessary, may not be performed due to financial restrictions. Because this measure underestimates financial constraints for the poorest groups, we propose to consider a new measure: potential affordability as an attempt into build a more realistic basket trip. It is computed considering motorized trip rates of the middle-class groups' as a benchmark. After analyzing potential affordability results, assessing its limitations and controlling by household composition we conclude that this is a very promising complementary measure since it helps to better understand the affordability gap for low-income groups.

This research provides a detailed analysis of the connectivity and accessibility of the Chinese railway network. The studied period starts in 1949 and ends in 2017. The research scope covers the railway system of the entire country (except Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao). Instead of focusing on main cities as research objects, this paper provides more detailed insights by using counties as the basic research units. The analysis shows that the achieved connectivity has been increasing continuously over the study period. Four accessibility indicators (temporal location indicator, weighted average travel time, daily accessibility, and potential indicator) provide comprehensive and complementary results, indicating that the most accessible cities and units are located in the southeastern part of the Hu line. In addition, higher economic level, or higher population density, is correlated with higher accessibility. Furthermore, the current network exhibits an unbalanced spatial distribution pattern, with an underdeveloped west. All the indicators show that the accessibility of the northwest and southwest regions is the lowest. Based on these conclusions, regional policy-making suggestions can be made to guide a rational railway network expansion and facilitate the equality and sustainable economic development of regions. The future railway system development is suggested to focus more on enhancing inner and inter-region communication in the west of China and attach importance to poverty-stricken counties in support of balanced regional growth and development. The railway development of the eastern regions needs to focus on optimizing the structure of the network as well as reasonably organizing railway routes.}

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to develop and apply a new method for assessing social equity impacts of distance-based public transit fares. Shifting to a distance-based fare structure can disproportionately favor or penalize different subgroups of a population based on variations in settlement patterns, travel needs, and most importantly, transit use. According to federal law, such disparities must be evaluated by the transit agency, but the area-based techniques identified by the Federal Transit Authority for assessing discrimination fail to account for disparities in distances travelled by transit users. This means that transit agencies currently lack guidelines for assessing the social equity impacts of replacing flat fare with distance-based fare structures. Our solution is to incorporate a joint ordinal/continuous model of trip generation and distance travelled into a GIS Decision Support System. The system enables a transit planner to visualize and compare distance travelled and transit-cost maps for different population profiles and fare structures. We apply the method to a case study in the Wasatch Front, Utah, where the Utah Transit Authority is exploring a switch to a distance-based fare structure. The analysis reveals that overall distance-based fares benefit low-income, elderly, and non-white populations. However, the effect is geographically uneven, and may be negative for members of these groups living on the urban fringe. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This paper reports on the effects of inaccessibility on Syrian refugees in Durham Region, a municipality abutting the City of Toronto. The transport and social exclusion framework is applied to determine whether transport poverty leads to inaccessibility, and how this impacts participation in daily activities and the wellbeing of recently landed refugees. A mixed methodological approach consisting of focus groups, survey data collection, and accessibility analysis provides a thorough and valid depiction of the topics investigated. The findings clearly depict evidence of subjective inaccessibility and its negative impact on participation in social and discretionary activities. At the same time, inaccessibility was not determined to be effecting participation rates in many mandatory activities such as daily English language classes or childcare-related tasks. Most of the respondents overwhelmingly felt that their transportation situation was having a strong negative impact on several dimensions of wellbeing, including loneliness and sadness. Despite the strong subjective and emotional responses to perceived inaccessibility, GIS-based accessibility scores show that the survey respondents had higher levels of objectively-measured access to destinations when compared to the broader population of Durham Region, indicating the importance of qualitative assessments of perceived access. Overall, the research confirms the validity of the transport and social exclusion framework and its usefulness in understanding participation and settlement outcomes among refugee migrants within a suburban, North American context.}

Most of the Chinese cities are built and being built as a car-centric city. Six million cars are registered in Beijing, and with passage of time the attraction of private vehicles increases. Increasing in infrastructure the selection towards private vehicle is boosting. Municipality of Beijing is busy to use the conventional ways to solve the congestion problem rather than the smart solution, what megacities need to adopt. Beijing is second-worst in length of communing time. This paper addresses the traffic congestion problem in the central part of the Beijing by using "Mixed Use Small Block Concept", where the network of roads spreads like veins in a human body, and the accessibility around center is dependent on vehicle. The aim is to recover the areas from cars and give it to residential and improve their accessibility by changing the mode of travel from car to walking and cycling, and provide clear boundaries and redesign the area by using Small Block Mixed use concept. Combining the public transportation, urban planning design and Non-Motorized Transportation priority will lead the city towards livability. The right to access every building in the city by private motorcars is actually the right to destroy the city." Mumford.}

To evaluate the accessibility of existing transit services and identify access gaps, it is critical to accurately estimate travel times between transit stops, which change throughout the day due to transit schedule variations. Commonly used methods in PTA ignore such temporal fluctuation. Moreover, these methods are unable to elucidate the causes of poor PTA. To address these issues, we first implemented an algorithm to effectively compute travel times at multiple departure times throughout the day in order to enable spatiotemporal PTA analysis. A series of indicators that are intuitive to interpret were developed to determine the varying causes of poor PTA and identify areas with immediate needs for improvements. We showcase the analytical framework using a transit network in the State of Utah operated by the Utah Transit Authority. The analysis is based solely on publicly-available open datasets, which makes it generally adaptable to other transit networks. Results can assist transit agencies with identifying areas in need of service improvement and prioritizing future investments. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

It contributes to the reduction of environmental pollution, climate change impacts and traffic congestion, and to the improvement of safety, well-being and health of citizens and transport affordability of low-income population. Moreover, cycling has the potential to enhance co-modality, when used in combination with public transit. The pursue of all these advantages is dependent on the availability of an effective cycle network and bicycle parking, well designed to satisfy users' accessibility needs, while guaranteeing adequate safety and security against the risk of bicycle theft.The aim of this study is to provide a spatial multicriteria GIS-based method for the prioritization of locations of the cycle stations within an urban area, in combination with the design of a cycle network. The method takes into account spatial data related to socio-economic information, public transport accessibility, attractiveness and presence of points of interest. The methodology is applied to Catania, a medium-sized city in the south of Italy, with poor cycle infrastructures, very far from European bike ridership and a strong car dependency, even for short trips. The methodology proves its ability to propose suitable locations for cycle stations so to effectively integrate the cycle network and its capability to connect main origins to destinations, while ensuring safety of riders.}

It is however often ignored that UD can provide benefits to not only special need groups but also to all passengers. UD measures can often be provided at relatively low costs. By enhancing public transport quality they can be justifiable based on a cost-benefit criterion.  This article documents valuation of different UD measures, estimated based on a stated preference (SP) survey among public transport passengers in Norway. The study suggests high valuations of UD measures among passengers. This potentially creates the case for setting priority on these measures when allocating funds for improving the quality of public transport based on a benefit-cost criterion.}

Paratransit is a demand-responsive service that often has variable schedules and routes, and may be designated for transportation-disadvantaged populations. It is a criterion-referenced assessment which was designed with three hierarchical sections for the three different paratransit service types as well as a trip planning and scheduling section. It is composed of 37 discrete tasks that are used to make a determination if an individual can use paratransit independently. This paper is on the validation process. The validation process was conducted with 98 study subjects who participated in the PaSA, of which 86 were retested, with 60 retests with non-paratransit users through in-vehicle trips, and 26 retests with current users through interviews about their revealed experiences in using paratransit services. The results indicate that PaSA is able to predict the capabilities of individuals on the autism spectrum to use paratransit services with a 96.4\% accuracy and a correlation coefficient of 0.995. The study subjects were found to be non-homogeneous in abilities and skills while the outcomes were found to be highly to moderately reliable. The research findings including the high accuracy rate provide validation that the PaSA is a reliable method for predicting an individual's ability to use paratransit services independently. However, individuals that were found to only have the six basic skills required for independent travel were recommended to have additional training prior to independent travel. These validation results can be useful for transit providers, transportation experts, and professionals working on issues with transportation-disadvantaged populations.}

Six representative indicators were formulated, including GINI coefficient, Theil index, mean log deviation, relative mean deviation, coefficient of variation, and Atkinson index, and incorporated into an equity maximization model to evaluate the performance sensitivity. A bilevel multiobjective optimization model was proposed to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions for link capacity enhancement in a stochastic road network design problem. A numerical analysis using the Sioux Falls data was implemented. Results verified that the equity indicators are quite sensitive to the pattern of network scenarios in the sense that the level of equity varies according to the amount of overall capacity enhancement as well as the assignment of improved link segments. The suggested multiobjective model that enables representing the Pareto-optimal solutions can provide multiple options in the decision making of road network design.

This tool deals with the trade-off between mobility and equity maximization under environmental capacity constraints. Two system objectives, maximization of mobility and equity, are formulated in terms of the sum of total car ownership and number of trips, and the differences in accessibility between zones. Environmental capacities are based on production efficiency theory in which the frontier emission under maximum system efficiency is taken as environmental capacity. To examine the performance of the proposed model, three types of hypothetical policies (network improvement, population increase and urban sprawl) are formulated. Effects are simulated using data pertaining to Dalian City, China. Results show that the proposed model is capable of representing the trade-offs between mobility and equity based on different policy interventions. Compared with two extreme cases with the single objective of mobility maximization or equity maximization, the Pareto-optimal solutions provide more interesting practical options for decision makers. Taking the solution based on the maximum equity as an example, the policy of urban sprawl yields the most significant improvement in both emission and accessibility of the three scenarios.}

Traditional active transportation safety analyses, however, take a reactive approach to traffic safety, only accounting for people currently walking or bicycling by analyzing crashes, injuries, and fatalities. This begs the question: which populations are most affected by traffic safety issues neglected by traditional crash analyses? To answer this, we developed a tool to proactively measure perceived traffic safety issues. We focused on child pedestrian and bicycle trips to and from schools in Denver, Colorado by measuring the number of children that would encounter roads perceived as unsafe. We converted these perceptions into barriers in a geographic information system network analysis to estimate trip suppression and used that as a proactive indicator of traffic safety. We finally examined-reactively and proactively-the socio-demographics of those affected via linear regression models and bivariate choropleth mapping. Results of both analyses suggest that negative impacts are borne disproportionately by low-income, low-education, Hispanic, and black neighborhoods. Proactive analyses results identified perceived safety issues in north and northeast Denver neighborhoods neglected by reactive analyses results. Findings suggest the inequitable distribution of traffic safety issues identified in past crash-based literature is graver than conventional reactive analysis would lead one to believe. By incorporating the proactive tool into traditional traffic safety analyses, we hope to better define the places and people that could most benefit from traffic safety improvements, thereby more effectively facilitating the benefits of walking and biking.}

  abstract = {Car use generates negative externalities, which are responsible for many health, environmental and economic problems. To tackle this issue, more work is needed to identify better the correlates of car use, especially at the contextual level. In this study, a mobility-focused questionnaire involving 1722 working French adults living in the Paris area (France) was used to explore gender-stratified relationships between residential socioeconomic deprivation and car use as the main transport mode against public transport, after controlling for potential confounders. While the vast majority of similar studies have assumed linear and global statistical relationships, the present work involved a random slope hierarchical generalised additive modelling framework, which revealed both non-linear and territorially-varying relationships. Among women, living in a more deprived neighbourhood was associated with an increase in the odds of reporting car use up to a certain threshold, after which the relationship plateaued, while among men, this relationship is linearly negative. In the most deprived department of the Paris region (Seine-Saint-Denis), living in a more deprived neighbourhood was associated with a lower odds of car use among men while a more complex nonlinear bell-shaped relationship was observed among women. The opposite was found in the wealthiest department (Yvelines), with a negative relationship among women and a U-shaped one among men. In Paris inner city, again a strong opposite trend was distinguished according to sex, with a negative relationship among women. These findings suggest that spatial contexts, characterised by complex interactions between socioeconomic factors, the built environment and the distance to Paris, play the role of moderators in the relationship between residential deprivation and car use. In conclusion, this study reinforces the idea that environment-transport relationships should be understood through local analyses (e.g. random slope multilevel or spatially-varying coefficients models) rather than global ones only, in order to guide specific public policies more effectively.}

An online survey was administered to a sample of annual members of Australia’s two bikeshare programs based in Brisbane and Melbourne, to assess motivations for joining the schemes. Non-members of the programs were also sampled in order to identify current barriers to joining bikeshare. Spatial analysis from Brisbane revealed residential and work locations of non-members were more geographically dispersed than for bikeshare members. An analysis of bikeshare usage in Melbourne showed a strong relationship between docking stations in areas with relatively less accessible public transit opportunities.  The most influential barriers to bikeshare use related to motorized travel being too convenient and docking stations not being sufficiently close to home, work and other frequented destinations. The findings suggest that bikeshare programs may attract increased membership by ensuring travel times are competitive with motorized travel, for example through efficient bicycle routing and priority progression and, by expanding docking station locations, and by increasing the level of convenience associated with scheme use. Convenience considerations may include strategic location of docking stations, ease of signing up and integration with public transport.}

The purpose of this study was to contrast the parental correlates of ATS choice specific to the Southeast with other areas of the US. Methods: This study utilized national data from 2952 households with school-aged children located within a 20-minute walk to a school. Parents reported their children's ATS behavior and their own ATS beliefs and perceptions. Logistic regression contrasted correlates of parents from the Southeast with other regions. Results: Parents in the Southeast, compared with parents across the US, were significantly less likely to allow their child to take ATS (12.9\% vs 33.3\%, respectively) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.46; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36-0.59). Specific to the Southeast, parental correlates linked to increases in ATS were Black race/ethnicity (OR = 1.68; 95\% CI, 1.31-2.60), being single, (OR = 1.71; 95\% CI, 1.15-2.54), and any parental physical activity (P value for trend = .0053). The only correlate associated with a decrease in ATS in the Southeast was heightened safety concerns (eg, traffic speed, safe crossings) (OR = 0.44; 95\% CI, 0.23-0.84). Conclusions: Among households with children in the Southeast, ATS interventions that allay parental safety concerns and that promote physical activity among parents might lead to increases in ATS.}

Despite the fact that this relationship has been tested in preceding studies, no clear pattern of correlation has been found between an individual's accessibility and his/her participation in out-of-home discretionary activities. Previous studies mostly applied aggregate, spatial accessibility measures that do not account for the heterogeneity related to an individual's spatio-temporal constraints. However, in addition to locations' spatial distribution, personal constraints related to the mandatory activities a person undertakes - and therefore, his/her available time budget throughout the day - impact activity choices and scheduling. This paper proposes a disaggregate, person-based accessibility measure that takes spatial and temporal constraints into consideration for the travel behavior of 11,599 individuals in the Wasatch Front region, Utah. This method is compared to an aggregate, home-based accessibility measure to assess both methods' ability to predict activity participation. The results show a highly significant, moderate correlation between the proposed person-based accessibility measure and participants' surveyed partaking in discretionary activities. Both the model prediction and the locally weighted regression smoother indicate that the greatest change in participation occurs within the mid-range of accessibility levels, and not in the low end of the accessibility range as was expected. In addition, the home-based method shows a negative and highly significant relationship to activity participation, which indicates that aggregate accessibility measures may provide counterintuitive findings.},

This study contributes to this line of inquiry by proposing a methodology for identifying public transit gaps, a mismatch between the socially driven demand for transit and the supply provided by transit agencies. The methodology draws on the latest accomplishments in the field of modeling time-continuous, schedule-based public transport accessibility. Accessibility levels to key destinations are calculated at regular time intervals, and synoptic metrics of these levels over various peak and off-peak time windows are computed for weekdays and weekends. As a result a temporally reliable picture of accessibility by public transport is constructed. The obtained index of public transport provision is compared to a public transport needs index based on the spatial distribution of various socio-demographics, in order to highlight spatial mismatches between these two indices. The study area consists of Flanders, which is the northern, Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. The results indicate that mainly suburban areas are characterized by high public transport gaps. Due to the time-variability of public transport frequencies, these gaps differ over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This study examined intrapersonal factors related to cycling to school among adolescents in two New Zealand cities based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Prototype Willingness Model. Data were collected from 803 adolescents (Christchurch: n = 373, Dunedin: n = 430; age 13–18 years; living =4 km from school; non-boarders). Despite similar attitudes towards cycling to school, Dunedin adolescents had lower prevalence of cycling to school (2\% versus 19\% in Christchurch) and also scored lower for all measures of injunctive norm, descriptive norm, self-perceived cycling capability and autonomy, and behavioral intention with respect to cycling to school compared to their Christchurch counterparts. The dominant influence on the intention to cycle to school was subjective norm in Christchurch and attitude in Dunedin. Future initiatives for encouraging adolescents to cycle to school should consider the contributions of intrapersonal factors, the social needs of adolescents, and the need to increase adolescents’ cycle skills.},

  abstract = {The urban Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) includes the target to provide "access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all" by 2030. However, debate exists around the best indicator to measure this target, and few actual measurements exist. This is in part because basic transit data are missing from many of the world's cities, including in Africa where popular or "informal" systems dominate. This paper explores how to make progress in measuring indicators for the SDG transport target using Nairobi's minibus system, matatus, as a case study. We partially measure the SDG indicator for the city as currently defined by the UN and then compare the SDG measurement to a location-based accessibility indicator that incorporates income data, travel times, and land-use considerations for Nairobi's highly monocentric spatial urban form. We show that although the SDG analysis suggests generally favorable transit coverage, it also points to underlying transport inequalities for low-income residents. The more fine-grained location-based accessibility analysis reveals rapidly decreasing accessibility to opportunities as distance increases from the city's central business district. This accessibility-based analysis further highlights income-based transport inequalities, identifying opportunities for improving integrated transport for residents living on the city's near and far peripheries. Improving non-motorized transport access for those living in low-income areas with high access potential would also be important to improve access. We recommend that cities start using open-source software and open data to measure a variety of indicators needed for data-driven policy, to meet SDG 11.2 and go further to improve access to opportunities for all residents.}

	abstract = {Public transport should, as might be assumed, allow for the mobility needs of all members of society to be fulfilled. This prerequisite should hold true whether the respective person is “just” the regular commuter on her or his way to work, the child on the way to school or the student travelling to university. However each of these persons has their individual needs and possibilities in coping with the barriers imposed on them. The commuter might be physically impaired and using a wheelchair, the child might not already be able to read and the student might suffer from impaired sight. All of these persons not only have a need of using public transport services but are entitled by law to receive the same opportunities as unimpaired passengers. This unhindered access to the daily mobility provided by public transport services however is rather seldom met. On the one hand this is due to public transport companies not having enough knowledge and awareness on the specific needs, barriers and possible solutions for impaired persons but also due to slack standards and regulations allowing authorities and providers to circumvent barrier-free re-designing of the existing systems. As can be deducted it is an absolute necessity to investigate the respective target groups separately to gather group-specific information that can then be translated into feasible plans for barrier-free designs. By far the largest group of handicapped persons requiring public transport systems for their daily mobility are persons with sight impairments. They constitute roughly 4-7\% of the overall population with a concentration on urban regions due to improved support options. Therefore it is economically relevant to public transport providers to optimally service sight impaired persons within their respective systems. Furthermore, solutions improving the accessibility for this group unfold their effects to all groups using their visual sense while at the same time improving the comfort of public transport. In a large scale research project at the Institute for Transport and Logistics Management of {WU} Vienna the needs and barriers to sight impaired passengers in public transport were investigated and evaluated. Based on these findings, possible solutions were developed and best and bad practices throughout Europe were identified. These practices were then rated with a newly developed indicator method incorporating the benefits to the target group as well as the technical and economic feasibility. The proposed article represents the third and final publication on the topic of “Sight impaired in public transport”. With it, the authors will close the circle of the last two European Transport Conferences. The authors are going to present the – appraised – (by our newly developed indicator) best and bad practices of solutions currently employed in public transport systems. On this basis, the authors are going to derive guidelines for public transport operators and public authorities on how to best address the needs of sight impaired passengers in their systems, while also keeping them economically efficient.},

  abstract = {It has been shown that the location of schools near heavily trafficked roads can have detrimental effects on the health of children attending those schools. It is therefore desirable to screen both existing school locations and potential new school sites to assess either the need for remedial measures or suitability for the intended use. Current screening tools and public guidance on school siting are either too coarse in their spatial resolution for assessing individual sites or are highly resource intensive in their execution (e.g., through dispersion modeling). We propose a new method to help bridge the gap between these two approaches. Using this method, we also examine the public K-12 schools in the Sacramento Area Council of Governments Region, California (USA) from an environmental justice perspective. We find that PM2.5 emissions from road traffic affecting a school site are significantly positively correlated with the following metrics: percent share of Black, Hispanic and multi-ethnic students, percent share of students eligible for subsidized meals. The emissions metric correlates negatively with the schools' Academic Performance Index, the share of White students and average parental education levels. Our PM2.5 metric also correlates with the traffic related, census tract level screening indicators from the California Communities Environmental Health Screening Tool and the tool's tract level rate of asthma related emergency department visits.}

Thus, the easier it would be the access of the residents from a city to another, the better it would be its opportunities of socio-economic development.  These effects motivated by the different degree of accessibility produced in the territory are more acute in the less developed regions. In this regard, this work proposes a methodology applicable not only to any place in general, but in this particular case also to Extremadura because this region is the least developed in Spain.  This methodology in which importance resides that it is applicable before the physical implantation of the HSR in the territory allows to achieve the following objectives: delivers a judgment if the distribution of the population which will accede to the HSR is balanced, shows the future hierarchical organization of the territory in more or less favoured zones and determines the degree of connection of the region on a national scale with Spain and an international scale with Portugal.  This paper is based on the use of tools for network design and the geographic information systems (GIS) and proposes a new indicator of absolute accessibility parameters application, together with the exploitation of information use of the descriptive statistics.  The obtained results show how the isolated areas, without adequate access to high-speed service, are going to continue to exist although it diminishes the lack of equity in the different zones of Extremadura, which is the object of study.},

Meanwhile, education equality safeguards the effectiveness of education systems and is an important part of social equality. This study analyzes the inequality of compulsory education from the perspective of imbalanced spatial distribution. Unlike previous studies that have measured the spatial distribution of education simply based on the spatial position of primary and secondary schools, we explore spatial accessibility based on the shortest travel distance from residents to schools, and then analyze the inequality of compulsory education through the distribution of spatial accessibility. We use 2873 Chinese counties as statistical units, and perform a statistical and graphical analysis of their spatial accessibility using the Theil index and spatial autocorrelation analyses. To analyze the differences in the spatial accessibility distribution on the national and regional levels, we use three partitioned modes: the terrain partitioned mode, the economic development partitioned mode, and the province-level partitioned mode. We then analyze the spatial agglomeration characteristics and distribution patterns of compulsory education accessibility through global autocorrelation, local autocorrelation, and hot-spot and cold-spot analysis. The results demonstrate an obvious imbalance in the distribution of spatial accessibility to compulsory education at the national level. Accessibility and equality in eastern and central regions are significantly better than those in the western region; both are significantly better in coastal regions than in inland regions; and equality alone is better in the municipalities, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing, than in other provinces and autonomous regions. The spatial pattern analysis shows significant global autocorrelation and obvious clusters. Counties in cold-spot areas (clusters of good spatial accessibility) are large in number but small in size. Cold-spot areas present a ring-shaped structure in space with Henan Province as the core. Counties in hot-spot areas (clusters of weak spatial accessibility) are not as numerous, but most are large in size; hot-spot areas are mainly in the northwest regions, characterized by complex terrain and severe economic difficulty. This study can provide significant information to aid policy making related to compulsory education sustainability in China and can facilitate research on the equality and sustainable development of compulsory education.}

  abstract = {The equity of transport accessibility is a prerequisite for sustainable development targets, especially in the ecologically fragile area of the Tibetan Plateau (also known as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau). The relationship between transportation supply and social demand has become a key element of socioeconomic development and environmental protection in agricultural and pastoral areas. Based on data from transportation networks, permanent populations and the economy, this study uses a network analysis model, the coefficient of variation and the Gini coefficient to construct an index of social demand in townships and analyse the equity of transport accessibility on the Tibetan Plateau between 1980 and 2017; the principle of geographic distribution and the spatial relationship between transport accessibility and social demand at the township scale are also discussed. This study finds the following: the development of transportation has improved accessibility on the Tibetan Plateau, creating a highly accessible region with important cities as the nodes and major traffic arteries as the axes; both the coefficient of variation of transport accessibility and the Gini coefficient have increased slightly; and the equity of transport accessibility among townships on the Tibetan Plateau has exhibited a downward trend. Further, the social demand index is doubling every ten years, the spatial distribution has regional characteristics, and a decrease in permanent populations is the main reason for declining social demand index scores among townships. Townships with the lowest and highest social demand index scores for transportation development enjoy greater transportation benefits; there is a significant spatial relationship between social demand and location conditions (potential accessibility); the aggregation of social demand and accessibility types follows specific geographical distribution principles; and the Mangya-Gongshan Line delineates the distribution characteristics of township clusters with low social demand and low accessibility.}

Descriptive analyses found bicycle sharers are largely educated, affluent, younger Caucasian males, a demographic that does not reflect the composition of bicycle share service areas. Website image analyses found that bicycle share users portrayed on program websites were more likely to be white (vs. non-white) but the distribution by sex and age was roughly proportional to the composition of bicycle share service areas. Findings suggest that bicycle share membership does not equitably reflect the communities where programs are operating, and that marketing communication practices may be a contributing factor.},

This indicates the need to study and assess the access to these mental health services especially with a focus on the vulnerable populations having the greatest need. As such, this paper presents a Geographical Information Systems (GIS)-based analysis in order to study and evaluate the accessibility of mental health facilities using the information on the spatial distributions of population and facilities, and regional traffic characteristics. For this purpose, different age group segments are utilized including the total population as well as those aged between 18 and 21, 22 and 49, 50 and 64, and those aged over 65 and 85. Focusing on the State of Florida, spatially detailed accessibility metrics are calculated with regard to healthcare facilities using travel times between population block groups and these critical mental health facilities. These estimates are used to calculate the weighted county accessibility scores for each county. Findings clearly delineate those counties that lack access to mental facilities, especially those in Northwest Florida, a demographically diverse and substantially rural region. This type of analysis can help planners and policy makers develop better strategies in order to provide adequate mental health care options needed in targeted locations.}

These services, enabled by technologies and inspired by the shared mobility paradigm, can complement and improve conventional public transport and reduce car use. The methodology was applied to Acireale, a small town in Southern Italy. A redesign of the existing bus network and its integration with a flexible service was formulated. A scenario analysis was carried out by the evaluation of a simple accessibility measure; the computation of the Gini coefficient was performed to measure the social equity of different scenarios. Results show an increase in equity with a lower coverage of traditional lines and the introduction of on-demand service. This approach based on easy-to-understand indicators can help the strategic planning of such services, which have the potential to find a trade-off between ridership and coverage as both desirable and conflicting goals in public transport planning.}

As a result, the distribution of these benefits has received relatively little attention in transportation planning, compared to transport-related burdens. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, we present an equity assessment of the distribution of accessibility in order to define the rate of "access poverty" among the population. We then apply this analysis to regional transportation plan scenarios from the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on measures of differences between public transit and automobile access. The analysis shows that virtually all neighborhoods suffer from substantial gaps between car and public transport-based accessibility, but that the two proposed transportation investment programs reduce access poverty compared to the "no project" scenario. We also investigate how access and access poverty rates vary by demographic groups and map low-income communities within access impoverished areas, which could be the subject of further focused investments.

This has fostered the development of assessment methodologies to quantitatively estimate the territorial impact of major transport infrastructures, which are particularly scarce at the intra-regional level. Linked to cohesion, polycentricity has been defined as the best spatial configuration to achieve balanced regions where population and opportunities are distributed among several entities linked by functional relationships. This paper aims to present a methodology to estimate these impacts based on the use of a new regional composite polycentricity indicator. The proposed indicator is tested by comparing the effects of conventional and high-speed railway (HSR) alternatives in the territorial system of a northern region of Spain. This quantitative assessment is a ranking tool for prioritizing rail network alternatives in terms of achieving the most balanced territory, which is especially relevant in countries where HSR networks follow cohesion goals. Our results show that new HSR links should only be complementary to regional railway services, and that the suppression of secondary lines should be avoided if a reduction in polarization is to be achieved.},

The PT needs refer to the identification of the possible spatial development of corridors, connecting areas of the urban agglomeration, in which there is the need of upgrading the overall performance of the PT services. The main novelties of the paper concern with the determination of the zones with a low “quality” of PT supply and the assessment of priorities and areas of upgrading of the PT system, so supporting the transport planning decisions. This paper focuses on measuring the equity in terms of “quality” of PT system using a new approach based on the computation of the GINI index and the Lorenz curve. In this context, the equity is related with the fair allocation of transport resources.The procedure proposed has been applied in a real-size context of the city of Rome. The case study shows promising results about the robustness of the proposed approach from the methodological point of view and the capability to assess effective measures in a real context. The results of the validation phase of the methodology and the results of the different phases of zone classification underline the strength of the choices made to represent the quality of public transport services and the GINI index approach. Specifically, taking into account the results by the point of view of equity, the GINI index shows a changes of about 7\%, that is a promising result considering the few zones selected for the identification of public transport needs.}

To conceptualize ‘urban transport justice’, the paper discusses three dimensions where injustices are apparent: Exposure to traffic risks and pollutants; distribution of space; and valuation of transport time. It is argued that public and political recognition of urban transport injustices provides significant argument for changes in urban planning, transport infrastructure development and traffic management.},

Results suggest that each kilometer driven by car incurs an external cost of €0.11, while cycling and walking represent benefits of €0.18 and €0.37 per kilometer. Extrapolated to the total number of passenger kilometers driven, cycled or walked in the European Union, the cost of automobility is about €500 billion per year. Due to positive health effects, cycling is an external benefit worth €24 billion per year and walking €66 billion per year.

However, vulnerable groups experience a distinct disadvantage in accessibility to shopping and supermarkets. These vulnerable social groups experience a substantially larger share of households with extremely low levels of accessibility, as a result of disproportionately low access to private vehicles.}

Our objective is to examine spatial relationships between modeled criteria air pollutants (i.e., nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, and ozone) and sociodemographics in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. Modeled air pollution offers environmental justice researchers a new and robust data source for representing chronic environmental hazards. Methods. We used multiple regression equations to predict criteria pollution levels using sociodemographic variables at the Census block group level. Results. We find that Census block groups with lower neighborhood socioeconomic status, higher proportions of Latino immigrants, and higher proportions of renters are exposed to higher levels of criteria air pollutants. Proportion African American, however, is not a significant predictor of criteria air pollution in the Phoenix metro area. Conclusions. These findings demonstrate clear social-class and ethnic-based environmental injustices in the distribution of air pollution. We attribute these patterns to the role of white privilege in the historical and contemporary development of industrial and transportation corridors in Phoenix in relation to racially segregated neighborhoods. Although all people are implicated in the production of criteria pollutants, lower-income and ethnic-minority residents are disproportionately exposed in metropolitan Phoenix.}

The metropolitan suburb is a special area for its location and rapidly changing population during urbanization. Taking Qingpu district, a suburb of Shanghai as a case, this study evaluated the spatial accessibility to healthcare services of 203 villages and neighborhoods based on the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method by ArcGIS software. The result shows that the spatial accessibility in the whole district is quite uneven under lower thresholds, and the spatial differences are beyond the traditional zoning of East Qingpu, New City and West Qingpu. The worst accessibility was mainly distributed at the edges of Jinze, Liantang and Zhujiajiao, while the best accessibility was mainly distributed in the New City and the region close around it. The average value of the spatial accessibility in Qingpu is 2.84, with a reach equal under 90 min threshold by bus index of 2.85, or an under 60 min threshold by self-driving index of 2.70. Secondly, the difference shows a new pattern, that is the spatial accessibility could be affected by both the New City and the Central City. Thirdly, the transportation mode, urbanization, the density of road network and bus lines, as well as the number of doctors in each healthcare service would directly affect the spatial accessibility. Lastly, in order to improve the spatial accessibility in metropolitan suburbs, greater effort is needed in increasing the numbers of bus stations and doctors, especially the areas which are farthest from the New City or the Central City, such as Jinze, and Lian Tang town in Qingpu. We acknowledge that the public transportation is vital to the accessibility to healthcare services. We also emphasize that healthcare services should be planned based on the anticipated future trends of population agglomeration. Our results for Shanghai are applicable to other big cities that are experiencing similar rapid urbanization in China, or other developing countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia, South America and Africa.}

  abstract = {Emerging transportation technologies (e.g., electric vehicles) and services (e.g., shared mobility) provide efficient, sustainable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional travel modes. However, whether these innovative technologies bring benefits to different population groups in an equal and reasonable manner is still an open question. The various methods applied to evaluate the equity performance of these systems are also not clearly comparable. In this paper, we comprehensively review methods from the existing literature for assessing the equity of a few important system outcomes: accessibility, traffic emissions, and safety. We also identify the existing challenges of analyzing equity for emerging transportation technologies. We unify the existing methodologies into a three-step framework that includes population measurement, cost/benefit measurement and equity assessment, and we summarize the applicable measurements for each step, in detail. A handful of literature focusing on emerging transportation technologies, such as shared mobility and autonomous vehicles, were also identified and surveyed; the methodologies used were found to fit with the three-step framework. We summarize the major findings and discuss promising directions for developing more sophisticated equity assessment methodologies for emerging transportation technologies. Overall, based on a comprehensive review, this paper contributes a framework for assessing the equity of transportation systems that integrates accessibility, traffic emissions, and safety outcomes. The summarized framework can be an overview resource to assist researchers and transportation planners who require equity analysis methods. The research gaps identified also provide directions for equity research on emerging transportation technologies.},

  abstract = {It has always been said that Bogota is one of the densest cities in the world, but what is not said is that density is distributed very differently within the urban area, with different effects on the population. This may create differences in location and access among socioeconomic groups. This paper shows four indicators that measure those differences, contributing to inequity in Bogota. The main goal of this paper is to organize facts rather than to explain their causes and quantify some data that always have been in the minds of planners, but never have calculated. First, the analysis of activity balance shows a monocentric pattern that contributes to important differences in travel time between income groups; second, spatial distribution of population and employment are different, generating higher travel times for the low-income population. Population density is higher in the boundaries of the city while employment decreases with distance to city center. An accessibility analysis for the different income levels was carried out, showing low accessibility indexes to work for more than 80\% of the low-income population. Those differences in access may contribute to the important differences in mobility among socioeconomic groups. In fact, high-income groups make 150\% more trips than low-income groups.},

A total of 608 people completed the survey, 37 per cent male and 63 per cent female. The average age category was 45 \&ndash; 54 years old with a majority of people from the Multiple Sclerosis Society (37 per cent) and the Association for the Blind (25 per cent). Almost all of the respondents (96 per cent) had public transport in their local area and 68 per cent used it at least once per month. In contrast, 92 per cent of respondents were either a passenger or driver of a private vehicle at least once per month. With respect to weekly transport choices, the most common mode of accessing work, recreation, shopping, education and medical appointments was the private vehicle (63 per cent followed by walking (17 per cent). Public transport accounted for 5 \&ndash; 20 per cent of transport depending on the purpose of the destinations.  The results suggest that it is vitally important to continue implementing the Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport Standards (2002) and improve access for people with disability to public transport, including taxis. Transport policy, however, should also consider further measures that maintain or improve access to a private vehicle for people with disability who need to use this mode of transport in order to avoid transport disadvantage. In addition, continued improvements in the local built environment (e.g. footpaths and connectivity) which facilitate walking for people with disability, especially to access local facilities and public transport, are also necessary to reduce transport disadvantage.}

UberWAV was launched in September 2015, providing wheelchair accessible vehicles equipped with a rear-entry ramp, winch, and restraints for riders who travel with a wheeled mobility aid. The objectives of this study were 1) to assess the equity performance of UberWAV by itself and in comparison to UberX by investigating the temporal and spatial distributions of the availability and accessibility of each service, and 2) to compare the availability, wait time, and price of UberWAV in Portland to the requirements in the city code. Demand-weighted probability of availability (WPA) and demand-weighted estimated time of arrival (WETA) were calculated for each service using Application Programming Interface (API) data extracted at 71 gridded locations in Portland, Oregon in 2018 and U.S. National Household Travel Survey data. WPA and WETA were then regressed over sociodemographic variables, controlling for spatial correlation, to investigate systematic patterns in access by neighborhood. Results indicate large disparities in availability between the WAV and standard Uber services. WPA of UberX was consistently over 99\%, while WPA for UberWAV averaged 62\% with substantial fluctuations by time of day. Average WETA for UberWAV was 18.8 min, 4.5 times higher than for UberX, and again had greater temporal variability. UberWAV met the service requirements in the Portland city code for availability and wait time under 30 min just 58\% of the time (demand-weighted). While UberWAV access was substantially poorer than for UberX, the access was not inequitably distributed with regard to neighborhood income or racial composition. UberWAV was more accessible in areas where a higher percentage of people with ambulatory disabilities lived. A larger fleet of UberWAV vehicles would be needed, particularly through the middle of the day, if Uber is to provide equal access for people using a wheelchair and to meet the requirements in the Portland city code.}

This research explores the differences between findings when access to greenspace is measured based on distance to any greenspace, total amount of greenspace to which residents have access, or a hybrid measure in which access is determined based on proximity to a threshold amount of greenspace. Not only do assessments of equity differ between the three approaches, but so do determinations of the impact of greening vacant land. Blacks, Hispanics and renters are more likely to live close to a public greenspace than whites or homeowners, but live in proximity to smaller overall amounts of greenspace. Greening vacant land increases the proportion of all residents who live within walking distance of a greenspace and lessens but does not eliminate differences in total greenspace access. The greatest effects of greening vacant land are seen in addressing differences in relative likelihood of having access to a threshold amount of greenspace.},

Great interest has therefore focused on impact estimation of transport infrastructures/services with respect to social, economic, and environmental sustainability. Among the consolidated assessment methods, the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is one of the quantitative tools representing the final stage (decision) in decision-making processes, which compares design alternatives and verifies the sustainability of a transport project. Recently the Italian Government proposed the national "Guidelines for Assessment of Investment Projects" based on CBA. The aim of this research is twofold: a) from a research point of view, to propose a sustainable evaluating method for impact assessment of the new transportation infrastructure aimed in performing both rational and shared decisions with the territories; b) for a practical point of view, to propose a first application of the CBA Italian guideline useful for the professional practice in the field of public investment evaluation. A quantitative impacts assessment of social, economic and environmental sustainability was performed for a revamping project of a new "greenway" in the south of Italy. Furthermore, also the social equity impacts produced by the new road infrastructure was also quantified, estimating the GINI indexes variation as a measure of effectiveness.}

  abstract = {Transport inequality analyses are often informed by accessibility estimates based solely on travel time impedance, ignoring other elements that might hinder access to activities, such as the monetary cost of a trip. This paper examines how and to what extent simultaneously incorporating both time and monetary costs into accessibility measures may impact transport inequality assessment. The authors calculate job accessibility by transit in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using cumulative opportunity measures under distinct combinations of temporal and monetary thresholds, and compare how inequality levels vary across different scenarios. They find that the most common research practice of disregarding monetary costs tends to overestimate accessibility levels. However, stricter monetary constraints do not necessarily result in more unequal scenarios. How accessibility inequality is affected by monetary costs is highly dependent on what combinations of temporal and monetary cut-offs are considered in the analysis. In the case of Rio, opting for lower monetary thresholds when looking at shorter trips leads to inequality levels lower than those found in the no monetary threshold scenario, but results in higher inequality levels when allowing for longer trips. The authors find that the impact of monetary costs on transport inequality estimates depend on a complex interaction between fare policies, the spatial organization and operational characteristics of transit systems, and the spatial co-distribution of opportunities and residential locations. The paper thus highlights that conclusions and policy recommendations derived from transport inequality analyses can be affected in non-intuitive ways by the interplay between temporal and monetary constraints. Future research should investigate how different combinations of travel time and monetary costs thresholds affect inequality estimates in different contexts.}

As urban areas gentrify, many low-income residents and communities of color have transitioned towards the exurban periphery. These suburban neighborhoods tend to have fewer employment opportunities and are fairly disconnected from public transportation networks serving the urban core. Using regional transportation plans (RTPs) for three California MPOs, we show that the transportation accessibility and environmental health issues affecting these exurban communities are unique and inadequately captured by the MPOs' current equity metrics. MPOs performance evaluation is regional and achieving equity within the urban core communities will not address emerging equity, accessibility and air quality concerns for exurban communities. With a brief history and a focused case study of RTPs for the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, and Fresno, we examine how air pollution, equity, and transportation interact in three different types of 21st century cities. We find that when allocating limited transportation funds, California metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) prioritize the improvement of existing public transportation in urban core areas over expansion of transit networks towards disconnected exurbs. This approach is an effective way to reduce vehicle miles traveled (and thus, air pollution) at the regional level due to high population concentrations in urban cores. However, this approach also concentrates the air quality benefits of VMT reduction in these same urban core areas. Exurban residents' on-road and near-road exposure to Traffic-Related Air Pollution (TRAP) will not be reduced by improving public transit within the urban core. We argue that although these suburban and exurban communities are a small percentage of the regional population, they have a right to share in the benefits of transportation investments, particularly given the historical and ongoing patterns of displacement and economic exclusion from urban core areas.}

Responding to FTA civil rights, Title VI, and environmental justice requirements, NYCT developed two quantitative and analytical approaches for forecasting equity impacts of fare restructuring decisions, in place of more traditional origin-destination surveys. The first approach uses standard aggregate fare elasticity models to estimate diversions between different fare classes and ridership losses resulting from fare adjustments. Average farechanges by fare media type are disaggregated with historical farecard usage patterns (consumption data) by subway station and bus route and translated into demographic variables (minority or non-minority and at, below, or above poverty) on the basis of census data. Overall average fare changes are used to analyze equity impacts. A second, more experimental approach identifies user demographics by daily first swipe locations and estimates daily average fares as actually experienced by each passenger by using sequential transactions on discrete farecards. To meet ongoing requirements, methods were developed to analyze impacts separately for peak and off-peak time periods and to demonstrate equity by using statistical tests. Impact analyses results and historical ridership, revenue, and market share data collected by the Metro Card automated fare collection system all inform fare structure design processes, with particular attention devoted to distributing fare increase burdens equitably.}

Associations between the address-level ULI and adult travel behaviours from the 2012-2014 Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) (n=12,323) were analysed using multilevel logistic regression. Sensitivity analyses to evaluate impact of methodological choices on distribution of liveability as assessed by the ULI and associations with travel mode choice were also conducted.ResultsLiveability estimates were calculated for 1,550,641 residential addresses. ULI scores were positively associated with active transport behaviour: for each unit increase in the ULI score the estimated adjusted odds ratio (OR) for: walking increased by 12\% (95\% Credible Interval: 9\%, 15\%); cycling increased by 10\% (4\%, 17\%); public transport increased by 15\% (11\%, 19\%); and private vehicle transport decreased by 12\% (-9\%, -15\%).ConclusionsThe ULI provides an evidence-informed and policy-relevant measure of urban liveability, that is significantly and approximately linearly associated with adult travel behaviours in the Melbourne context. The ULI can be used to evaluate progress towards implementing policies designed to achieve more liveable cities, identify spatial inequities, and examine relationships with health and wellbeing.}

In this article, the authors ask: If streetcars promote economic development, do the benefits of that economic development accrue to existing residents of the neighborhood, or is the degree of change so great that the neighborhood experiences extensive population turnover? Ideally, new investment in a neighborhood would result in new economic advantages for residents, in the form of new jobs or business opportunities, greater mobility due to transit improvements, and higher real estate values. Alternatively, the change associated with the streetcar project may be so profound that pre-existing residents are unable to hang on and are forced out due to increasing rents and/or cost-of-living. The authors apply these questions to analyses of streetcar stations in Portland OR, Seattle WA, New Orleans LA, and Salt Lake City UT. They use demographic and employment data to study neighborhoods surrounding streetcar stops in their four cities before and after the streetcar project, in comparison with control sites, and in a shift-share analysis. Overall, the authors see profound shifts occurring at most of their streetcar study sites. The patterns vary, but these locations are certainly loci of demographic change, and at many of them the data are in line with some classic indicators of gentrification, including shifts toward more white and Asian, highly-educated and higher-income populations.}

We assessed child care facilities' proximity to heavily traveled roadways in an attempt to estimate the extent of potential exposure of young children to vehicle-related pollution in this understudied microenvironment.Methods. We examined approximately 24000 licensed child care facilities in California located within 200 m of heavily traveled roadways.Results. Approximately 57000 of the available slots in California child care centers (7\% of the overall capacity) are in facilities located within 200 m (650 ft) of roadways averaging 50000 or more vehicles per day, and another 172000 (21\%) are in facilities located within 200 m of roadways averaging 25000 to 49000 vehicles per day. Facilities providing care to infants or preschool-aged children and facilities located in disadvantaged areas were more often situated in medium- or high-traffic areas.Conclusions. Additional research is needed to further clarify the significance of the child care microenvironment in terms of potential childhood exposures to vehicle-related pollutants. Design strategies, notification standards, and distance-based siting restrictions should be considered in the facility licensing process and in land use and transportation planning.}

It can provide a significant improvement in the quality of city life with minimal ecological impact. Thus, public bike-sharing systems have been adopted as a modal choice in many cities worldwide. However, there are some problems that must be addressed when designing a bike-sharing system, one of which is how to improve service quality and attract more users. This study proposes a hybrid model, combining the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATAL) method with the Analytical Network Process (ANP) approach (called DANP), which addresses the dependent relationships between the various criteria for the quality of service for bike-sharing systems to better reflect the real-world situation. After building a complex evaluation system, a modified VIKOR (VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje) method is applied to explore the weighted-gap to the aspiration levels. Furthermore, given the vagaries of human judgments and ratings, preferences cannot be assigned an exact numerical value, which can make it difficult to evaluate the performance or make comparisons. One way to improve upon this uncertainty is to apply Grey Theory. The proposed method is then applied using data for Taipei's Youbike and Obike systems. The analytical results and the resultant managerial applications for improving the service quality of both bike-sharing systems are also discussed with particular attention to the current policies of Taipei City.

The percentage of people who are unable to access health services due to long travel times increases. This paper takes Donghai County as the study unit to analyse areas with physician shortages and characteristics of the potential spatial accessibility of health services. We analyse how the unequal health services resources distribution and the New Cooperative Medical Scheme affect the potential spatial accessibility of health services in Donghai County. We also give some advice on how to alleviate the unequal spatial accessibility of health services in areas that are more remote and isolated.Methods: The shortest traffic times of from hospitals to villages are calculated with an O-D matrix of GIS extension model. This paper applies an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method to study the spatial accessibility of health services and to determine areas with physician shortages in Donghai County. The sensitivity of the E2SFCA for assessing variation in the spatial accessibility of health services is checked using different impedance coefficient values(a). Geostatistical Analyst model and spatial analyst method is used to analyse the spatial pattern and the edge effect of potential spatial accessibility of health services.Results: The results show that 69\% of villages have access to lower potential spatial accessibility of health services than the average for Donghai County, and 79\% of the village scores are lower than the average for Jiangsu Province. The potential spatial accessibility of health services diminishes greatly from the centre of the county to outlying areas. Using a smaller impedance coefficient leads to greater disparity among the villages. The spatial accessibility of health services is greater along highway in the county.Conclusions: Most of villages are in underserved health services areas. An unequal distribution of health service resources and the reimbursement policies of the New Cooperative Medical Scheme have led to an edge effect regarding spatial accessibility of health services in Donghai County, whereby people living on the edge of the county have less access to health services. Comprehensive measures should be considered to alleviate the unequal spatial accessibility of health services in areas that are more remote and isolated.},

  abstract = {A central issue in urban inequity has to do with distributive justice in the costs and benefits associated with urban transport, and whether certain population groups are systematically disadvantaged about mobility, accessibility, affordability, and externalities, the preponderant factors in transport poverty. This article proposes a methodology for analyzing how investment in transport infrastructure and non-housing construction, mobility levels (trip distances, times, and speeds) and the associated trip costs (monetary, accidents, pollution, and energy consumption) are distributed across the different socioeconomic quintiles of a city. The methodology was applied to the real-world case of Santiago de Chile. The results showed that compared with the lowest income quintile, people in the highest income quintile made 1.2 times more trips at an average speed 1.6 times higher. In relation to costs, the richest quintile generated 6.7 times as much pollution and used 7 times as much energy but consumed a significantly lower share of their income (10\% vs. 45\%). In addition, the top quintile was the beneficiary of 2.5 times more investment in both transport infrastructure and new construction space for commercial activities and services over the period considered. Finally, private car use in the top quintile was 5.3 times greater. This transport mode accounts for 6.8 times more of the accident rate than public transport, bicycles, or walking combined. This clearly inequitable scenario points to the needs for progressive policies that target lower income groups and promote a more rational use of cars in view of their negative impacts on the city.},

Increasing the supply of affordable housing in accessible locations helps achieve multiple planning objectives: it reduces transportation costs, improves economic opportunity for disadvantaged groups, reduces accident risks, conserves energy and reduces pollution emissions. In recent years researchers have developed analysis methods for measuring total housing and transportation costs for different locations within cities, called a Housing and Transportation (H þT) Affordability Index. This study applies this type of analysis in Qom City, Iran. The results indicate that suburban-area households spend more than 57\% of their monthly income on housing and transport, significantly more than the 45\% spent by households in the central district. This is consistent with research results in other urban areas. This illustrates the feasibility of applying housing and transportation affordability analysis in developing country cities to help identify truly affordable and sustainable development.},

The level of exposure to adverse environmental factors is detrimental to human health and is directly related to urban and transport planning practices.Objective: To estimate the premature mortality burden of non-compliance with international exposure guidelines for air pollution, noise, access to green space and heat for Barcelona and Madrid (Spain), and its distribution among the population by the socioeconomic status (SES).Methods: The Urban and TranspOrt planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) tool was applied and the attributable premature mortality due to non-compliance with recommended exposure levels was estimated. The distribution of the attributable mortality burden among the population by SES was investigated through Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) adjusting for spatial autocorrelation and a cluster analysis was performed to identify attributable mortality hot spots. Results: Annually, 7.1\% and 3.4\% of premature mortality in Barcelona and Madrid, respectively, could be attributed to non-compliance with the international exposure recommendations for air pollution, noise, heat and access to green space. In addition, analysis by SES showed that in Barcelona lower SES areas had an overall greater attributable mortality rate, while in Madrid, the distribution of the attributable mortality burden by SES varied by exposure.Conclusion: This study shows the impact of environmental exposures on mortality and highlights the importance of taking integrated actions when designing cities considering the health impacts, but also the specificities of each city such as the socio-demographic context. Moreover, the high precision scale of the analysis enables the identification of environmental hazards and mortality hot spots providing a powerful tool to support prioritysetting and guide policymakers towards a healthy, sustainable and just city for all of their residents.}

  abstract = {Lima, as the capital of Peru, has become its first megacity with more than 10 million people in an area that extends over 80 km in a North-South direction. As a city of this size, it faces complex mobility issues with a strong reliance on informal transport modes (buses, minibuses, and paratransit vehicles) due to the deterioration of its transit system quality during the 20th century. This paper examines the current urban situation in Lima through an analysis of the city’s structure, with an emphasis on its transport history and the resulting types of walking, transit, and car-oriented fabrics that can be identified. The mobility analysis was made through data collection, including daily trips by public and private modes, annual passenger kilometers and vehicle kilometers of travel, length of exclusive lanes for public transport and freeways, car and paratransit modes ownership, transport emissions, and safety. These data are used to position Lima in a comparative global context showing its relative strengths and weaknesses in urban form and mobility and providing suggestions for a more sustainable transport and land use system. It is asserted that Lima is an informal transit-oriented city, as distinct from recognized transit metropolises (e.g., Tokyo or German cities such as Berlin or Munich), which often involve private companies, operating under an umbrella of strong government regulation, fare setting, and high service standards. Lima is shown to have some important qualities such as a high density, comparatively low car ownership and freeway provision and still healthy levels of transit and non-motorized mode use despite non-ideal conditions for either. These qualities, if combined with effective governance structures, government commitment to higher quality formal transit systems, which better integrate the important informal transit sector, cessation of high capacity road building, greater protection and encouragement for non-motorized modes and some effective controls over growing car and motorcycle ownership, would see Lima develop a more sustainable transport system.},

The spatial extent of health impacts associated with road-transport pollutants have traditionally been explored through the examination of artificially created buffers, defined by subjective distances from specified major road links. Within this paper an alternative approach is presented using boundary statistics, which describe naturally occurring shifts of magnitude in socio-environmental and health outcomes across the wider urban area. In contrast, previous distance-threshold investigations have used arbitrarily sized buffers placed upon predetermined locations in response to environmental attributes, without considering the combined influence of additional social burdens. The demographically diverse City of Leicester, situated within the heart of the United Kingdom's major road-transport network, was selected to showcase such methods.Descriptive multilevel modelling strategies accommodating for generalised spatial structures across Leicester, globally associated issues of deprivation, road-transport emissions and ethnic minorities with increased respiratory risks. Getis-Ord Gi* spatial pattern recognition statistics identified the existence of localised variations, with inner city neighbourhoods tending to house children of ethnic minority groups whom experience disproportionately large environmental and respiratory health burdens. Crisp polygon wombling boundary detection across Leicester appeared to broadly complement the Gi* statistics, identifying naturally occurring boundaries in road-transport emissions to result in elevated children's respiratory admissions within a distance of 283 m (P {$<$} 0.05). The designated threshold was identified to reduce in relation to certain ethnic groups, thus suggesting environmental injustices likely prevail within the model British multicultural City of Leicester. The study's findings have applications within healthcare management and urban planning for locating vulnerable populaces and for minimising health risks in future road network designs.

We used geographic information system data to measure physical access: service areas around each supermarket were delineated by ability to walk, bicycle, ride transit, or drive within 10 minutes. We assessed economic access by stratifying supermarkets into low, medium, and high cost. Combining income and access criteria generated multiple ways to estimate food deserts.Results. The 5 low-income group definitions yielded total vulnerable populations ranging from 4\% to 33\% of the county's population. Almost all of the vulnerable populations lived within a 10-minute drive or bus ride of a low-or medium-cost supermarket. Yet at most 34\% of the vulnerable populations could walk to any supermarket, and as few as 3\% could walk to a low-cost supermarket.Conclusions. The criteria used to define low-income status and access to supermarkets greatly affect estimates of populations living in food deserts. Measures of access to food must include travel duration and mode and supermarket food costs.},

However, shared mobility activities in NYC highly concentrate in wealthier areas with better transit access and less transit-dependent population. The findings indicate that without effective and appropriate policy and planning guidance, shared mobility may exacerbate transport equity issues even though they appear to be particularly adept at serving transit-dependent travelers.}

The research proposed in this article aims to examine the situation of public transport stops in the city of Cáceres in accordance with the criteria required by current legislation on universal accessibility. In this context, an attempt has been made to identify the architectural barriers faced by users of the service who have some physical limitation. After an in-depth evaluation of the existing regulations and identification of the technical requirements to be met, a critical study of compliance with the legislation in force is carried out on the existing bus stops on the different urban public transport lines. Subsequently, constructive solutions are provided in case of non-compliance, with the aim of arranging the adequacy of urban transport in terms of accessibility. In order to achieve this goal, specific solutions for improvement are formulated in several areas under study. Furthermore, the main operational problems detected in the accessibility infrastructures for this means of transport are identified. Finally, after having analysed in detail the problems of the urban public transport stop network, it can be concluded that most of them are the result of the lack of coordination between the general urban development plan and the sustainable urban mobility plan, which makes it impossible to provide an adequate service.},

  abstract = {The EU Green Deal sets challenging goals for cities, including a 90\% reduction in Green House Gas (GHG) emissions from transport by 2050. This requires an integrated and coordinated approach to urban mobility planning, represented by Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs), and encouraged by European policies. However, the experience of cities with SUMPs varies substantially among the EU Member States. Using qualitative and quantitative methods of data analysis, this paper aims to explore the institutional settings, practices, and barriers to sustainable mobility in Czech cities and differences between cities with and without a SUMP. The data were collected using interviews and an online questionnaire survey among stakeholders who substantially influence the urban planning praxis. The data reveal that monitoring, evaluation, and public involvement are underestimated by analyzed cities and the perception of a need for a significant transport behavior change is still quite low among local politicians. A SUMP brings substantial benefits to Czech cities of all sizes, even in the initial phase of its implementation. The cities that have developed a SUMP apply various sustainable transport measures more often, create more participation activities, and are better at evaluation than cities without a SUMP.}

However, to date a science-driven scoring system to assess the policy environment for cycling and walking is lacking. In this study, spreadsheet-based scoring systems for cycling and walking were developed, including six dimensions (cycling/walking culture, social acceptance, perception of traffic safety, advocacy, politics and urban planning). Feasibility was tested using qualitative data from pre-specified sections of semi-standardized interview and workshop reports from a European research project in seven cities, assessed independently by two experts. Disagreements were resolved by discussions of no more than 75 minutes per city. On the dimension "perception of traffic safety", quantitative panel data were used. While the interrater agreement was fair, feasibility was confirmed in general. Validity testing against social norms towards active travel, modal split and network length was encouraging for the policy area of cycling. Rating the policy friendliness for cycling and walking separately was found to be appropriate, as different cities received the highest scores for each. Replicating this approach in a more standardized way would pave the way towards a transparent, evidence-based system for benchmarking policy approaches of cities towards cycling and walking.},

It is operationalised using 157 weekly activity-travel diaries data collected from three case study areas in rural Northern Ireland. A review of activity space and travel behaviour research found that six dimensional indicators of activity spaces were typically used including the number of unique locations visited, distance travelled, area of activity spaces, frequency of activity participation, types of activity participated in, and duration of participation in order to identify transport disadvantage. A combined measure using six individual indices were developed based on the six dimensional indicators of activity spaces, by taking into account the relativity of the measures for weekdays, weekends, and for a week. Factor analyses were conducted to derive weights of these indices to form the PI measure. Multivariate analysis using general linear models of the different indicators/indices identified new patterns of transport disadvantage. The research found that: indicator based measures and index based measures are complement each other; interactions between different factors generated new patterns of transport disadvantage; and that these patterns vary in space and time. The analysis also indicates that the transport needs of different disadvantaged groups are varied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  abstract = {Using GIS to evaluate travel behaviour is an important technique to increase our understanding of the relationship between accessibility and transport demand. In this paper, the activity space concept was used to identify the nature of participation in activities (or lack of it) amongst a group of students using a 2 day travel-activity diary. Three different indicators such as the number of unique locations visited, average daily distance travelled, and average daily activity duration were used to measure the size of activity spaces. These indicators reflect levels of accessibility, personal mobility, and the extent of participation, respectively. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the impacts of students socio-economic status and the spatial characteristics of home location. Although no differences were found in the levels of accessibility and the extent of participation measures, home location with respect to a demand responsive transport (DRT) service was found to be the most important determinant of their mobility patterns. Despite being able to travel longer distances, students who live outside of the DRT service area were found to be temporally excluded from some opportunities. Student activity spaces were also visualised within a GIS environment and a spatial analysis was conducted to underpin the evaluation of the performance of the DRT. This approach was also used to identify the activity spaces of individuals that are geographically excluded from the service. Evaluation of these results indicated that although the service currently covers areas of high demand, 90\% of the activity spaces remained un-served by the DRT service. Using this data six new routes were designed to meet the coverage goal of public transport based on a measure of network impedance based on inverse activity density. Following assessment of public transport service coverage, the study was extended using a spatial multi criteria evaluation (SMCE) technique to assess the effect of service provision on patronage.

	abstract = {Transportation systems play a pivotal role in facilitating access to out-of-home activities, enabling participation in various aspects of social life. But because of budgetary and physical limitations, they cannot provide equal access everywhere; inevitably, some locations will be better served than others. This realization gives rise to two fundamental concerns in transportation equity research and practice: (1) accessibility inequality and (2) accessibility poverty. Accessibility inequalities may rise to the level of injustice when some socioeconomic groups systematically have lower access to opportunities than others. Accessibility poverty occurs when people are unable to meet their daily needs and live a dignified and fulfilling life because of a lack of access to essential services and opportunities. In this paper, we review two of the most widely used approaches for evaluating transport justice concerns related to accessibility inequality and accessibility poverty: Gini coefficients/Lorenz curves and needsgap/transit desert approaches, respectively. We discuss how their theoretical underpinnings are inconsistent with egalitarian and sufficientarian perspectives in transport justice and show how the underlying assumptions of these methods and their applications found in the transportation equity literature embody many previously unacknowledged limitations that severely limit their utility. We substantiate these concerns by analysing the equity impacts of Covid-19-related service cuts undertaken in Washington, D.C. during 2020. The paper also discusses how alternative methods for measuring transportation equity both better comport with the known impacts of such changes and are consistent with underlying moral concerns.},

Onboard survey data and census data can be used to estimate equity effects, although there is no clear reason to conclude that these two sources will lead to the same findings. Guidance from the FTA recommends the use of either of these data sources to estimate equity impacts. This study made a direct comparison of the two methods for the public transit system in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. The results indicated that although both sources were acceptable for FTA compliance, the use of one or the other could affect whether a proposed service change was deemed equitable. In other words, the outcome of a service change equity analysis could differ as a result of the data source used. To ensure the integrity and meaning of such analyses, FTA should recommend the collection and use of ridership data for conducting service change analyses to supplement approaches that are based on census data.}

Using spatial data from 1990 and 2000 and a geographical information system, the present study examined the degrees and spatial variations of accessibility disparity between commuting by car and public transit as well as the temporal changes in this disparity in the metropolitan areas of Boston and San Francisco. In both metropolitan areas there was a considerable disparity in job accessibility in a comparison between users of cars and public transit, which turned out to differ substantially by location. Between 1990 and 2000 regional levels of this accessibility disparity lessened in the two metropolitan areas, but the temporal changes in the accessibility disparity varied considerably among different locations within the metropolitan areas. The accessibility disparity decreased in the majority of central areas and in a number of suburban zones near rail stations, whereas the accessibility disparity increased in a number of suburban zones near major highways. Improving accessibility for public transit, relative to that for cars, should be a key strategy for redressing auto-orientation urban spatial structure, an important objective of sustainable development.}

However, these topics have not often been integrated in research or practice. This paper introduces a method to assess the extent to which reductions in "Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress" (LTS) on segments of a citywide bicycle network increase accessibility to supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, and public libraries. Six accessibility performance measures are developed and evaluated for 278 neighborhoods in Baltimore, Maryland using a GIS-based approach. The demographic distributions of accessibility results are further analyzed, focusing on disadvantaged populations. Using a set of 106 proposed bicycle projects, the marginal accessibility gains and cumulative demographic impact across affected neighborhoods are assessed for each project. These results are ranked and crosslisted to identify a set of projects that balance accessibility gains with equity objectives. The prioritization results demonstrate some overlap with the short-term priorities embodied in City of Baltimore's 2015 Bike Master Plan, but they also highlight projects in other areas, specifically those that would serve neighborhoods most disadvantaged in terms of racial segregation, high poverty rates, and low rates of vehicle ownership.}

Not only does walking have the potential to benefit health, it can also be used as a form of transport, reducing reliance on motorised transport and reducing CO2 emissions. However, little is known about the distribution of such features within urban environments. Furthermore, debate surrounds whether people living in areas with high deprivation face the 'double jeopardy' of high deprivation and environments that are unsupportive of walking.This study aims to address this knowledge gap by developing measures of the built environment considered to support walking and assessing and whether there is a relationship between these with area-level deprivation in urban Scotland. It also examines the geographic distribution of these measures in two of Scotland's biggest conurbations. Three aspects of the physical built environment considered to reflect Area Walking Potential (AWP) were created which are considered to show good walking environments, there were residential density, intersection density and destination accessibility, as well as an overall walkability index (a combination of the three measures). The results showed no evidence of deprivation amplification with higher concentrations of the AWP measures in more deprived areas. Those living in the least deprived areas having the lowest levels of the measures. However, spatial analysis showed unequal distribution of these measures, with concentrations of high AWP clustered together with lower AWP scores in peripheral areas. These results support the growing evidence base of unequal geographic distribution of AWP. These results matter for developing built environments to support walking because it is important to understand how existing patterns of AWP to target interventions appropriately. Awareness of associations between AWP and deprivation is important for policies aimed at ameliorating multi-level inequalities demonstrating where people are likely to be experiencing both low AWP and high deprivation.}

Finally, consideration is given to the possibility of a virtual mobility-related dimension of exclusion and to the possible social implications of inclusion of virtual mobility in an integrated transport strategy.},

Six strategies for dealing with the problem of distributive justice are explored and examined and then applied in a common setting to a public project where several efficient alternatives are proposed. While this research is not prompted by the desire to proclaim a winner from among the strategies, it is evident that some strategies make heroic attempts to reduce inequity.

Vienna, Austria, was ranked by the EIU as the most liveable city worldwide in 2018 and 2019. However, the relationship between a liveable as well as healthy and environmentally-just city has not been previously explored. To explore whether the most liveable city is also a healthy and environmentally-just one, we estimated the premature mortality burden related to non-compliance with international exposure level recommendations for physical activity (PA), air pollution (PM2.5 and NO2), road traffic noise, green space and heat for Vienna, as well as its distribution by socioeconomic status (SES). We applied the Urban and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) methodology and estimated the annual mortality, life expectancy (LE) and economic impact of non-compliance with exposure guidelines for the Viennese adult population {$>$}= 20 years. We compared current with recommended exposure levels, quantified the association between exposures and mortality and calculated attributable health impact fractions. Eight percent of premature mortality (i.e. 1239 deaths, 95\% CI: 679-1784) was estimated to be attributable to non-compliance with the recommended exposure levels. Seventy-six percent of the attributable premature mortality was due to PM2.5 exposure and insufficient PA. Non-compliance also resulted in an average of 199 days of LE lost for the adult population (95\% CI: 111-280) and an economic impact of 4.6 (95\% CI: 2.5-6.7) billion 2015(sic) annually. Overall, residents of lower SES neighbourhoods faced higher risk of premature mortality due to higher exposure to NO2, road traffic noise, heat and less green space. Despite high liveability standards according to EIU definition, a considerable premature mortality burden was attributable to non-compliance with exposure recommendations, and socioeconomic inequalities were estimated. Although the exposure attributable mortality burden was lower than in other European cities and local Viennese policies favour the reduction of motorized traffic, alongside the promotion of active and public transport and urban greening, there is room for further alignment of liveability, environmental health and justice objectives.}

In support of the hypotheses, we found that (Study 1, N = 326; Study 2, N = 130), compared with higher SES participants, lower SES participants perceived one-sidedly disadvantageous distribution during the dictator game as less unfair. Moreover, a behavioral experiment in Study 2 showed that such tolerance for unfair treatments were associated with subsequent passive reactions in the ultimatum game. Taken together, the results imply a vicious cycle whereby the SES differences in a tendency to accept unfair treatments lead to psychological responses that may maintain or even strengthen the existing social disparities.},

Accessibility of NRSs was measured by pedestrian direction API and spatially clustered by local indicators of spatial association (LISA). Equity was examined using the Mann-Whitney U test to test the difference between socioeconomic and built environment variables between high and low accessibility areas. We found that vulnerable groups favored access to the NRSs over more affluent groups. This study's results suggest that urban planners and designers should contemplate ways to enhance the walkability of the residents and continually monitor accessibility to prevent urban problems, such as food deserts and retail deserts.

This development raises concerns whether the benefits from the extended {HSR} network would again be limited to the initial {HSR} corridors and will deepen the inequalities in accessibility with the rising issue of uneven regional development of the country. This paper measures the accessibility of each stage of {HSR} network extension and evaluates its spatial distribution, variation, and changes using weighted averaged travel time and potential accessibility indicators. The results of this study find different accessibility impacts from each stage of {HSR} extension. Although travel-time reduction and increased attractions have been widened in more cities by each {HSR} extension, the spatial equity is degenerated by the extension in 2010/2011 as the improvement of accessibility has been concentrated in cities along the primary {HSR} corridor near the already-advantageous Seoul capital area. In contrast, the future {HSR} extension in 2018 will enhance equitable accessibility to the isolated regions such as the northeast and the southwest regions of the country. However, the relative degree of accessibility improvement will not be large enough for increasing the spatial equity of accessibility without more extended {HSR} networks between provinces.

  abstract = {Planners and planning scholars have debated the effects of public transit on changes in various employment outcomes. However, few studies have tried to understand how public transit affects employment changes in a community while accounting for housing costs at the same time. As an update to and methodological advance on early studies, this study aims to measure light rail transit (LRT) systems' impacts on the change in labor participation and housing affordability. This study uses the decennial Census and 5-year American Community Survey (ACS) data at the block group level and conducts propensity score matching in 12 selected LRT systems across the U.S. opened between 2000 and 2010. By comparing growth rates of the average weeks worked and the median gross rent between treatment and control groups, the results show that an introduction of an LRT station increases the average weeks worked-a measure of labor participation-while not raising the median gross rent. Further analysis also shows that the increased average weeks worked after operation of LRT systems is a result of an increase in the percentage of full-time and year-round workers and a decrease in the proportion of part-time and part-year workers. Ultimately, the findings provide planners and policymakers with a better understanding of the effects of LRT systems on the economic stability of urban communities.}

Based on the data inventory, a regression method was applied to discover whether there was a correlation between the presence of bicycle facilities and the occurrence of bicycle crashes.Results: This study identifies that longer distance between crosswalks and bus stops are positively associated with bicyclist crashes, while structured medians contribute to the reduction of bicycle crashes. This study also suggests that parking lot entrance ways and parking lots with no physical barrier from sidewalks cause bicycle crashes on sidewalks.Conclusions: This study presents guidelines for local transportation planners to analyze the patterns of bicyclist crashes in order to improve roadway safety. This research also assists planners in effectively allocating scarce resources as they address issues of bicyclist safety.}

Focusing on one structural barrier, we examined geographic accessibility to comprehensive, coordinated HIV care (HIVCCC) in the US South. We integrated publicly available data to study travel time to HIVCCC in 16 Southern states and District of Columbia. We geocoded HIVCCC service locations and estimated drive time between the population-weighted county centroid and closest HIVCCC facility. We evaluated drive time in aggregate, and by county-level HIV prevalence quintile, urbanicity, and race/ethnicity. Optimal drive time was 30min, a common primary care accessibility threshold. We identified 228 service locations providing HIVCCC across 1422 Southern counties, with median drive time to care of 70min (IQR 64min). For 368 counties in the top HIV prevalence quintile, median drive time is 50min (IQR 61min), exceeding 60min in over one-third of these counties. Among counties in the top HIV prevalence quintile, drive time to care is six-folder higher for rural versus super-urban counties. Counties in the top HIV prevalence quintiles for non-Hispanic Blacks and for Hispanics have {$>$}50\% longer drive time to care versus for non-Hispanic Whites. Including another potential care sourcepublicly-funded health centers serving low-income populationscould double the number of high-HIV burden counties with drive time 30min, representing nearly 35,000 additional people living with HIV with accessible HIVCCC. Geographic accessibility to HIVCCC is inadequate in the US South, even in high HIV burden areas, and geographic and racial/ethnic disparities exist. Structural factors, such as geographic accessibility to care, may drive disparities in health outcomes. Further research on programmatic policies, and evidence-based alternative HIV care delivery models improving access to care, is critical.},

In addition, presents the partial correlation coefficients for walking and the NEWS-A score, adjusted for social demographic variables. Overall, land use mix-diversity (P{$<$}0.034) and land use mix-access (P{$<$}0.014) showed a positive relationship with walking.Discussion: Examination of the reliability of the Korean NEWS-A scale based on Korean adults who reside in large cities showed that all items had statistically satisfactory reliability. Korean NEWS-A scale may be a useful measure for assessing environmental correlates of walking among population in Korea.}

These standards denote the extent and placement of greenspaces, but rarely consider their form and function. Arguably, an inclusive evaluation of greenspace social equity requires the comparison of greenspace types. To address if greenspace types are socially equitable, I develop a novel spatial analytic approach that classifies 4265 greenspaces according to twelve functional, physical characteristics. I then compare the social equity of these greenspace types using multiple operationalizations of social equity (provision, accessibility, and population pressure) throughout 4524 neighborhoods in a capital city in Australia. I find that greenspace social equity varies for each of these types. For example, results reveal that affluent households have an abundance of amenity rich greenspaces and few amenity poor ones. Further, by comparing across multiple social equity operationalizations, I find that affluent households may have a deficit of the amenity poor greenspace type, but live closer to this type. These findings confirm that employing a greenspace typology and multiple social equity operationalizations can deepen our understanding of the association between social equity and greenspace provision. This spatial analytic approach is both adaptable for examining other urban land use types, and portable to other urban contexts, and can aid urban planners, researchers, and policy makers to understand how to improve the social equity of publicly beneficial greenspace types.

Using linear regression models and 2000-2001 US Census data, we investigated the relationship between 5 neighborhood census characteristics (income, education, racial/ethnic composition, age distribution, and sex) and 5 walkability indicators in almost 65,000 census tracts in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Data on the built environment were obtained from the RAND Corporation's (Santa Monica, California) Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (median block length, street segment, and node density) and the US Geological Survey's National Land Cover Database (proportion open space and proportion highly developed). Disadvantaged neighborhoods and those with more educated residents were more walkable (i.e., shorter block length, greater street node density, more developed land use, and higher density of street segments). However, tracts with a higher proportion of children and older adults were less walkable (fewer street nodes and lower density of street segments), after adjustment for region and level of urbanicity. Research and policy on the walkability-health link should give nuanced attention to the gap between persons living in walkable areas and those for whom walkability has the most to offer.}

Therefore, it is important to understand rural-urban differences in access to medical care. This study compared the percentage of individuals with a usual source of care and characteristics of usual source of care providers across 3 urban-rural categories.Methods: This study identified 51,920 adults from the 2014-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and estimated the percentage with a usual source of care across the rural-urban categories. Then, differences in a variety of provider characteristics were examined. Estimates were weighted to be representative of the U.S. non-institutionalized population and adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, self-rated health, and presence of chronic conditions. Analysis was conducted in 2018 and 2019.Results: Compared with metropolitan county residents, residents of the most rural counties were 7 percentage points more likely to have a usual source of care (81\% vs 74\%), but their providers were 13 percentage points less likely to be physicians (22\% vs 35\%). Despite having to travel longer to reach their usual source of care providers, residents of the most rural counties were 18 percentage points less likely than metropolitan residents to have usual source of care providers with office hours on nights and weekends (27\% vs 39\%).Conclusions: Rural-urban differences in access to care are complex; there is a rural disadvantage on some dimensions of access but not others. To understand rural-urban disparities in healthcare access, research should move beyond the usual source of care provider as an overall indicator and instead investigate disparities using multiple indicators of access based on theoretically distinct domains.

While efficiency was identified as an important factor on utility bicycle trips, it might be traded for experienced safety, for example by choosing different pathways in a given situation, or by relinquishing one's right of way. In a semi-controlled study with 41 participants, a grouping was made according to self-reported riding speed in relation to other cyclists. The participants cycled twice along a 3 km inner-city route, passing four intersections with different priority rules. The cyclists were free to choose how to negotiate the intersections. Speed and the traffic surroundings were recorded via gps and cameras on the bike of the participant and of a following experimenter. For each cyclist, the 'base' speed on undisturbed segments was determined as reference. Based on this, the efficiency in different types of intersections was computed per cyclist group. It turned out that infrastructural aspects, cyclist group and the presence and behaviour of interacting traffic influenced cyclist efficiency. Faster cyclists were delayed more when the infrastructure required a stop regardless of the traffic situation, like at a red traffic light or a stop sign. The members of the so-called 'comfort cyclists' group were delayed the most in a roundabout with mixed traffic, where many chose to get off their bike and walk. In a society working for equality of access to the transport system, it is recommended to develop solutions that consider and accommodate the behaviours of different cyclist groups when planning bicycling infrastructure.

The results show that (1) the mean value of the accessibility index is positively correlated with the 95th percentile frequency of shopping, indicating that reductions in activity opportunities are correlated to a decreased transport service level, and that (2) for those less capable of going outdoors (ADL score is lower than 11), a low accessibility level tends to reduce opportunities for shopping.},

This paper emphasizes the revenue-generation opportunities and welfare impacts of flat-tolling schemes, standard congestion pricing, and credit-based congestion pricing policies. While most roadway investment decisions focus on travel time savings for existing trips, this work turns to logsum differences (which quantify changes in consumer surplus) for nested logit specifications across two traveler types, two destinations, three modes and three times of day, in order to arrive at welfare- and revenue-maximizing solutions. This behavioral specification is quite flexible, and facilitates benefit-cost calculations (as well as equity analysis), as demonstrated in this paper.The various cases examined suggest significant opportunities for financing new roadway investment while addressing congestion and equity issues, with net gains for both traveler types. Application results illustrate how, even after roadway construction and maintenance costs are covered, receipts may remain to distribute to eligible travelers so that typical travelers can be made better off than if a new, non-tolled road had been constructed. Moreover, tolling both routes (new and old) results in substantially shorter payback periods (5 versus 20 years) and higher welfare outcomes (in the case of welfare-maximizing tolls with credit distributions to all travelers). The tools and techniques highlighted here illustrate practical methods for identifying welfare-enhancing and cost-recovering investment opportunities, while recognizing multiple user classes and appropriate demand elasticity across times of day, destinations, modes and routes.

Based on existing findings on inequalities of walkability, we ask whether this relation varies between neighborhoods with low and high incomes. Walk Score is used to measure walkable access while the State of Place Index is applied to synthesize the qualitative urban form dimensions collected as part of the Irvine Minnesota Inventory. Simple bivariate correlations and difference-in-means tests assess the relationship and difference in average scores between the two. We draw on an existing sample of 115 walkable neighborhoods in the Washington, DC metro area that Mariela Alfonzo and colleagues had collected for previous research and that we augmented to include additional low-income neighborhoods. Our results reveal a strong and positive overall association between walkable access (Walk Score) and walkability (State of Place). However, this association masks problems with the quality of the walking environment that are significantly larger in low-income neighborhoods (even those with very good walkable access), especially regarding connectivity, personal safety, and the presence of litter and graffiti. As a proxy for walkability, Walk Score's walkable access measure is, therefore, not equally strong across all neighborhoods but declines with income. In this sense, Walker's Paradise is more walkable in higher than low-income neighborhoods.}

The disparities of selected environmental indicators-exposure to traffic noise (road, rail, and air), NO2, external safety risks, and the availability of public green space-are analyzed both separately and in combination. Not only exposures to environmental burdens ("bads") were investigated, but also access to environmental benefits ("goods"). Additionally, we held interviews and reviewed documents to grasp the mechanisms underlying the environmental equity situation, with an emphasis on the role of public policy. Environmental equity is not a priority in public policy for the greater Rotterdam region known as the Rijnmond region, yet environmental standards have been established to provide a minimum environmental quality to all local residents. In general, environmental quality has improved in this region, and the accumulation of negative environmental outcomes ("bads") has been limited. However, environmental standards for road traffic noise and NO2 are being exceeded, probably because of the pressure on space and the traffic intensity. We found an association of environmental "bads" with income for rail traffic noise and availability of public green space. In the absence of regulation, positive environmental outcomes ("goods") are mainly left up to market forces. Consequently, higher-income groups generally have more access to environmental "goods" than lower-income groups.}

Differences in accessibility can potentially cause negative health and social welfare implications. Accessibility and service area analyses from the perspective of access equality are typically rather simple. They are often based on arbitrary travel-distance thresholds and made only with a single mode of transport in mind. Thus, they exclude the multidimensional nature of accessibility where individuals' travel behavior and perceived accessibility also play an important role. In this paper, a PPGIS method was used to empirically investigate distances and durations that respondents travel with different modes of transport to access popular water environments. Service area analyses were built on person-based and objectively measured threshold values that not only take into account the spatio-temporal elements of transport networks and a land use component but also recognize the requirements and preferences of individuals and their capacity to access and participate. The results showed that the most common mode of transport to access waters is walking. Generally, the residents travel by foot for 1.7 km to access water environments. Cars were found as the second most common mode of transport used, and most of the popular water environments are accessible by car from every corner of the study area in a given travel threshold time. The results demonstrate the importance of deriving local parameters and the potential of the PPGIS approach for accessibility and service area delineation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a unique product of the rapid urbanization of past decades, urban village has become a major obstacle for sustainable redevelopment because of its sub-standard infrastructure and disordered built environment. Redevelopment of 'villages in the city' (ViCs) is distinct from normal urban redevelopment because it involves the change of collective land ownership without de jure property rights to state land ownership with de jure property rights. What site characteristics, what ownership type, what geographical characteristics, make village sites more likely to be redeveloped? This study addresses this question with particular reference to industrial sites in Shenzhen. An analytical framework is developed based on the concept of rent gap to analyze the possible effects of these factors. An empirical investigation is conducted based on a set of data that covers all 44 village-owned industrial sites in the Nanshan District in Shenzhen. The findings suggest that village sites with better accessibility to good transportation facilities and the city centre are significantly more likely to be redeveloped and thus will be integrated into formal urban areas earlier than those located in less accessible areas. It is also demonstrated that fragmented land ownership and lack of legal land rights are not significant barriers for the sustainable redevelopment of such sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the quality of pedestrian infrastructure remains poor in Indian cities, leading to inconvenience and high risk to pedestrians. To assess this quality, pedestrian accessibility audits were conducted around 360 bus stops in Delhi. To ensure representativeness, bus stops were selected based on multicriteria stratified sampling, with the following three criteria: relative risk of pedestrian fatality, socioeconomic variables, and distance from city center. The Public Transport Accessibility (PTA) toolkit was used, which has a specific checklist of measurable definitions for rating the access indicators. PTA scores for pedestrian accessibility were predominantly low across Delhi. There was significant spatial clustering of the scores, indicating spatial disparity in the quality of pedestrian infrastructure, which was found to be in tandem with the spatial disparity of income levels. The authors advocate that this toolkit can be used effectively by city authorities and policymakers to undertake location- and indicator-specific improvements in pedestrian infrastructure around PT stops. This toolkit is pertinent for Indian cities, because virtual streetscape audit tools are not currently available. (C) 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Transport infrastructures and motorized vehicle traffic in urban areas often act as barriers to walking and cycling. The present study introduces the characterization of this process, also known as "community severance", caused by a railway in a Brazilian medium-sized city. Moreover, it also investigates the equity in the distribution of residents, regarding demographic characteristics, along the railway and around the different types of railroad crossings and segments without railroad crossings.Materials and methods: Based on census data related to permanent mobility constraints, income level, gender and age, we georeferenced the data and estimated the number of residents living around the railway. In addition, the types of railroad crossings and segments without railroad crossings were classified by means of a qualitative assessment, according to an ordinal scale of relevance. Furthermore, we used the chi-square (chi(2)) test of independence and standardized Pearson residual to verify evidence of associations between the variables and to understand the nature and strength of dependence between each category of the variables.Results: The results provide evidence of associations between the variables and indicate deficits and excesses of residents with certain demographic characteristics in the railway surroundings. They also show that residents with some difficulty in walking or climbing stairs or aged over 60 tend to live nearby the best railway crossings, while residents aged up to 19 tend not to live nearby the best railway crossings. On the other hand, low-income residents (less than R\$ 1200.00) tend to live nearby the worst railroad crossings.Conclusions: The research indicates that the distribution of the number of residents along the types of railroad crossings and segments without railroad crossings is equitable for residents with permanent mobility constraints, by gender and for the elderly, whereas it is not equitable for low-income residents and aged up to 19 years old.}

One of the ways to ensure a child-friendly and healthy daily walk to school is to increase the greenery that children encounter on their way. This paper aims to evaluate welfare-related disparities among children in the visibility of greenery along their home-school routes and link them with distributive (in)justice regarding aesthetic appreciation. We hypothesise that children who belong to poor welfare-related status group have lower visibility of greenery along their routes to school than other children. Furthermore, we hypothesise that aesthetic appreciation provided by the greenery surrounding home-school routes is not equitably distributed to all children. For this purpose, we conducted a visibility analysis for primary school pupils in Lodz (Poland). In particular, we quantified the amount of greenery in the visibility areas of 5, 10, 30 and 50 m along the home-school routes of children. Our results show that the median visibility of greenery along the home-school routes is lower for shorter visibility distances (5 and 10 m) and street trees, dense tree and shrub canopies what could be further related to limited aesthetic experiences. We found that children who belong to poor welfare-related status group have less greenery along their home-school routes than others. This could indicate a distributive environmental injustice may occur not only in terms of the availability of green spaces for inhabitant's homes but also reveal disparities in the visibility of greenery during daily commutes. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on making cities greener. In particular, they may be used by urban planners to identify priority streets for implementing urban green initiatives.}

When aiming to improve social inclusion, by making sustainable transport modes accessible to all, it is important to understand the factors driving perceived accessibility. Unlike conventional accessibility measures, perceived accessibility focuses on the perceived possibilities and ease of engaging in preferred activities using different transport modes. We define perceived accessibility in terms of how easy it is to live a satisfactory life with the help of the transport system, which is not necessarily the same thing as the objective standard of the system. According to previous research, perceived accessibility varies with the subjectively-rated quality of the mode of transport. Thus, improvements in quality (e.g. trip planning, comfort, or safety) increase the perceived accessibility and make life easier to live using the chosen mode of transport. This study (n=750) focuses on the perceived accessibility of public transport, captured using the Perceived Accessibility Scale PAC (Lattman, Olsson, \& Friman, 2015). More specifically, this study aims to determine how level of quality affects the perceived accessibility in public transport. A Conditional Process Model shows that, in addition to quality, feeling safe and frequency of travel are important predictors of perceived accessibility. Furthermore, elderly and those in their thirties report a lower level of perceived accessibility to their day-to-day activities using public transport. The basic premise of this study is that subjective experiences may be as important as objective indicators when planning and designing for socially inclusive transport systems.}

   abstract = {Transportation systems around the world have been designed in a way that emphasizes the pre-eminence of motorized mobility, in particular the private car. This has led to the emergence of transportation monocultures, defined as systems where the ability of travelers to use various modes is constrained. In order to create transportation polycultures, alternative modes of transportation must be available and users must perceive them as feasible alternatives to the car. This implies changing the modality style (a predisposition towards certain modes) and increasing the modality (number of alternatives available and feasible for use) of travelers. The objective of this paper is to investigate the modality of respondents to a travel survey in McMaster University, Canada. We define modality as the self-reported number of modes that respondents consider available/feasible for their daily commute, including the chosen mode. Analysis is based on the application of an ordered probit model. The results of our study indicate that modality is influenced by a combination of demographic, attitudinal and spatial/land use variables. With respect to mode of travel, active travelers tend to have a higher modality compared to users of motorized modes. Car users who live in more densely built environments are more likely to report higher levels of modality, whereas density reduces the modality of users of local transit. Distance from McMaster reduces the modality of car and local transit users. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Uncertainties in travel times due to traffic congestion and delay are risks for drivers and public transit users. To avoid undesired consequences such as losing jobs or missing medical appointments, people can manage the risks of missing on-time arrivals to destinations using different strategies, including leaving earlier to create a safety margin and choosing routes that have more reliable rather than fastest travel times. This research develops a general analytical framework for measuring accessibility considering automobile or public transit travelers' heterogeneous strategies for dealing with travel time uncertainty. To represent different safety margin plans, we use effective travel time (expected time + safety margin), given specified on-time arrival probabilities. Heterogeneity in routing strategy is addressed using different Pareto-optimal routes with two main criteria: faster travel time vs. higher reliability. Based on various safety margin and routing strategy combinations, we examine how accessibility changes under varying safety margin plans and routing strategies. Also, we define and measure robust accessibility: geographic regions that are accessible regardless of the safety margin planning and routing strategy. Robust accessibility can provide a conservative and reasonable view of accessibility under travel time uncertainty. To demonstrate the applicability of the methods, we carry out an empirical study on measuring the impacts of new transit service on healthcare accessibility in a deprived neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio, USA.}

As a result, funding for pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure in the United States has increased substantially in recent years. However, pedestrian and bicycle equity impacts often go overlooked, which has resulted in an inequitable distribution of active transportation costs and benefits. The paper contributes to this small but growing field by developing an enhanced understanding of active transportation equity, identifying limitations in research and in practice, and providing a set of recommendations for planners and researchers. These recommendations include considering other transportation-disadvantaged groups beyond low-income and minority populations in equity analysis, adopting new performance measures, increasing inter-agency coordination, the need for stronger guidance from the federal government, and more representation from transportation-disadvantaged groups in the public participation and decision-making process. If the costs and benefits of active transportation are to be fairly shared among all users, equity will need to be meaningfully addressed in the planning process.}

Gould (1969) once stated that it is a 'slippery notion ... one of those common terms that everyone uses until faced with the problem of defining and measuring it'. Considerable research over the last 40 years has been devoted to defining and measuring accessibility, ranging from access to jobs within an hour's travel time to the ease at which given places can be reached. This article is concerned with the measurement of access provided by transit. It includes a review of past work on measuring accessibility in general and with respect to transit services in particular. From this overview of the literature, it can be seen that current methods fall short in measuring transit service access in several meaningful aspects. Based on this review and critique, we propose new refinements that can be used to help overcome some of these shortcomings. As a part of this, we define an extended GIS data structure to handle temporal elements of transit service. To demonstrate the value of these new measures, examples are presented with respect to mapping accessibility of transit services in Santa Barbara, California. Finally, we show how these measures can be used to develop a framework for supporting transit service analysis and planning.}

In contrast, this paper argues that as the goal of transportation policy shifts from promotion of mobility to improvement of accessibility, the desirability of congestion pricing policies becomes conditional upon specific elements of their design.  This mobility-accessibility distinction is used to distinguish different implementations of congestion pricing.  A mobility-based congestion pricing promises to alleviate congestion but threatens to deteriorate from overall regional accessibility as it accelerates metropolitan deconcentration. Accessibility-based congestion pricing avoids acceleration of sprawl by incorporating policies to ensure that drivers who are priced off roads are replaced with residents and travelers arriving at previously congested areas by other means. Without such policies, the economic vitality of congested areas would be threatened by the restriction of customer and employee flows.  It also is argued that a mobility-based policy will tend to concentrate benefits at the high end of the income spectrum, while an accessibility-based policy will spread benefits more equitably.}

These works present various theories of justice, either implicitly or explicitly, within the context of transportation financing, investments, and service allocations. While explicit normative reviews as well as arguments have been presented, implicit applications and imprecise definitions of equity theories have largely obfuscated and oversimplified this expansive topic.

The results are presented for each type of road users (pedestrians, car passengers, car drivers, motorised two-wheeler riders, cyclists, public transport users).Young persons from deprived municipalities use motorised-two wheelers, bicycles and the car (as passengers and drivers) less frequently, they walk more and take public transports more often than those from other municipalities.When considering injury risk, motorised two wheeler injuries among adolescent males, for example, are significantly less frequent in deprived municipalities. But the motorised two-wheeler riders as well as car passengers from deprived municipalities are characterized by an excess injury risk, whether the selected denominator is the number of users or the kilometres travelled by this mode.For the first time in France, this study has enabled a comparison of the effects of a contextual socioeconomic indicator (the type of municipality of residence, deprived, or not) on daily travel practices and injury incidences among the population, among the users of each mode and per km of travel.

An integrated network and raster-based model is applied to accurately measure the accessibility indicators. We perform analysis at four different geographical planning levels - island, corridor, spillover, and county level. The HSR with a non-polarized topology can increase the accessibility of the entire island and corridor, but only leads to a slight increase in the spillover areas without HSR stations. HSR construction also leads to spatial cohesion for the entire island and corridor. Although the circular HSR network consists of several HSR stations distributed relatively equally, the results show that counties contribute differently to the cohesion of the entire island due to the varied initial level of accessibility values. Moreover, the county-level analysis reveals that the internal changes of each county are also different with balancing, polarization, and neutral effects appearing. Therefore, the internal equity of counties needs to be combined with their external contributions to global equity. Our framework permits policymakers to make customized HSR transport policies at different planning levels, particularly for an isolated area.}

The integration of bicycling and transit has been acknowledged as a strategy to increase the mode share of bicycling and the efficiency of public transit by solving the first- and last-mile problem. However, the economic outcomes of jointly promoting neighbourhood bikeability and transit accessibility are still poorly understood. This study aims to assess the property value impact of neighbourhood bikeability, transit accessibility, and their synergistic effect by analysing the single-family and condominium property sale transactions during 2010-2012 in Austin, Texas, USA. Our Cliff-Ord spatial hedonic modelling approach, which is also known as the general spatial model (or SAC), controls for the spatial dependent effects in the sale price and the error terms simultaneously. In order to quantify neighbourhood bikeability and transit accessibility, we use Bike Score and Transit Score as publicly available indices. We have assessed how residents' willingness to pay (WTP) for bikeability and transit accessibility depend on various socio-demographic and built-environment factors, and whether the WTP is influenced by the bicycle-transit synergy. The results from this research show that jointly enhancing bikeability and transit accessibility can generate positive synergistic effects on property values. The effects would behoove policy makers to pursue the coordination of bicycle master plans with regional transit plans and to consider strategies of spatially-joint bicycle and transit investment.}

However, the limited research studies exploring this topic were all conducted abroad with different transport systems. This paper thus investigates the barriers to public transport in Singapore's context for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).Methods: In collaboration with a special needs school, parents of students with ASD were invited to complete the questionnaire online about their children's travel experiences. From a total of 25 parents, details of their children's frequency of travel, independent public transport experiences (if any) and challenges of independent commuting were examined. Based on the survey findings, a requirement list was compiled as a basis for creating a design concept to address public transport barriers of individuals with ASD.Results: Key requirements summarised from the survey include quiet environments, assistance in alighting, assistance in boarding, predictable travel routines, simplified ways to ask for help, supervision or support, more visual aids, emergency buttons, learning to ask for seats and priority seating. ViCo, a Virtual Companion at bus stops and in buses and trains is proposed in the current paper to address the requirement list of individuals with ASD as highlighted in the survey findings.Conclusion: The proposed implementation of ViCo is expected to improve the commuting experience of individuals with ASD, but can be extended to serve individuals with diverse disabilities as well as people without disabilities.}

A case study in the city of Charlotte is conducted and a comprehensive gap analysis based on the proposed methodology is performed. Results show that the transit supply provides higher service coverages in the central business district of Charlotte and decreases as the distance to downtown Charlotte increases. Most of the identified transit-dependent areas are suburban and rural communities located on the fringe of the city. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to examine the impact of different walking distances on transit gaps. Guidelines are developed and best-practice recommendations for the use of GTFS data as a main data source are made to better understand and assess public transit equity and accessibility for public transportation planning and operation. Several policy implications are also drawn in terms of enhancing the public transit system equity and accessibility.}

  abstract = {Two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) methods that account for multiple transportation modes provide more realistic accessibility representation than single-mode methods. However, the use of the impedance coefficient in an impedance function (e.g., Gaussian function) introduces uncertainty to 2SFCA results. This paper proposes an enhancement to the multi-modal 2SFCA methods through incorporating the concept of a spatial access ratio (SPAR) for spatial access measurement. SPAR is the ratio of a given place's access score to the mean of all access scores in the study area. An empirical study on spatial access to primary care physicians (PCPs) in the city of Albuquerque, NM, USA was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of SPAR in addressing uncertainty introduced by the choice of the impedance coefficient in the classic Gaussian impedance function. We used ESRI StreetMap Premium and General Transit Specification Feed (GTFS) data to calculate the travel time to PCPs by car and bus. We first generated two spatial access scores-using different catchment sizes for car and bus, respectively-for each demanding population location: an accessibility score for car drivers and an accessibility score for bus riders. We then computed three corresponding spatial access ratios of the above scores for each population location. Sensitivity analysis results suggest that the spatial access scores vary significantly when using different impedance coefficients (p {$<$} 0.05); while SPAR remains stable (p = 1). Results from this paper suggest that a spatial access ratio can significantly reduce impedance coefficient-related uncertainties in multi-modal 2SFCA methods.},

This work largely elides issues related to youth and student travel. Existing work on school trip mode choice does not engage deeply with the equity implications of its findings. Education equity researchers identify the abstract notion of choice as equity enhancing but do not engage with the realities of disparate transportation resources and infrastructure. In this review essay, we articulate the contours of transportation equity, youth travel, and school choice research. We use emerging perspectives on “mobility justice” to frame the issues and provide vocabulary that can help bring education and transportation together in planners’ everyday work. Takeaway for practice: A mobility justice framework encourages critical thought and action to address the root causes of inequities. Our conclusions make three contributions to research and practice: 1) challenging school district leaders to think about choice systems designed for access to schools, not just access to information about available options; 2) clarifying the broader implications of school choice by refusing to look away from the racial implications of forecasts; and 3) elucidating the need for a regional perspective.},

The researchers used a geographic information system to link data from the Texas Department of Transportation crash record information system and the pavement management information system. Linking the data provided an opportunity to examine in depth the impact of pavement conditions on traffic crashes. This study analyzed the correlation between four key pavement condition scores and crash rates on a large number of crashes on Texas asphalt nonfreeway roadways between 2008 and 2009. The results overwhelmingly suggest that very good pavement conditions coincide with much lower crash rates compared with very poor conditions. The findings of this study provide insights into how pavement conditions might affect crash rates on different types of roadways. The study also provides critical knowledge that may lead to improvements in safety-oriented pavement design. Because of funding shortages, many state roadways suffer severe pavement deterioration, which may result in increased crash rates, as this study suggests. The findings of this study serve as scientific justification for more adequate maintenance of roadways to avoid further safety deterioration. The researchers recommend that state highway agencies maintain fair or good pavement conditions, at a minimum, on all major state highways. When possible, very good pavement conditions should be maintained to reduce crashes.}

  abstract = {Public transit offers older adults an important alternative travel mode for accessing social activity destinations. Given the growing size and socioeconomic diversity of the older population, transportation planners should consider how current urban transit systems can better meet their needs. In this study, we examine the time-varying accessibility to senior centers by public transit in each census tract of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Senior centers are community service and activity hubs for older adults which are typically overseen by the local area agency on aging. They offer a variety of services and social activities for older adults, including free meals, volunteering opportunities, information, and technology training. Using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data and socioeconomic data from the U.S. Census Bureau, we analyze how accessibility varies across census tracts with respect to the tract's share of older adults, particularly those in vulnerable subgroups. We found that accessibility to senior centers declines from the downtown area to the suburbs but varies considerably among the vulnerable subgroups studied. We also found that when accounting for the open hours of senior centers, accessibility to senior centers is generally lower around midday (2 PM) than during peak hours (8:30 AM) on Mondays. We used the vertical equity index to examine social disparities in accessibility among older adults. We found that while SEPTA underserves neighborhoods with higher shares of older adults, tracts with higher shares of some vulnerable subgroups are better served than those with lower shares. Specifically, neighborhoods with higher shares of households that have no cars are better served than those with higher shares of African American and Hispanic older adults. These results suggest that the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) and the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging (PCA) should work together to better accommodate the diverse travel needs of older adults.}

  abstract = {In recent decades, transit equity has become a recurrent topic within the domain of sustainable transportation, where accessibility is a crucial indicator. However, the measurement of accessibility and equity in existing studies is usually based on the route with the shortest travel time, whereas multiple travel routes and corresponding travel costs remain unexamined. Taking the ground access to Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) as an example, this study aims to fill the previous research gaps by examining the equity of accessibility by public transport simultaneously considering different sets of route options and corresponding total travel costs. These routes have either the shortest travel time or the maximum time-saving benefit-monetary cost ratio. Results reveal spatial variation in the total travel cost, which reflects considerable horizontal inequity. The results, however, indicate that vertical equity exists because the total travel cost is positively correlated with median income level across different locations. In addition, the route that provides a reasonable benefit-cost ratio further improves the equity in accessibility to HKIA. The study illustrates the significance of simultaneous consideration of total travel costs and multiple routes in the assessment of accessibility equity. It also provides transferrable methods for evaluating transit equity.}

However, most studies primarily focus on the relationship between commuting and hedonic well-being. Few studies have investigated the commuting experience and eudaimonic well-being. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between the commuting experience and both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, using Heze (China) as a case study. The results indicate that, first, educational attainment is related to hedonic well-being, and transport mode is related to both the commuting experience and hedonic well-being. Furthermore, we found that some combinations of individual characteristics and transport mode are related to the commuting experience and hedonic well-being, but none of them relates to eudaimonic well-being. In addition, there are strong positive correlations between the commuting experience and hedonic well-being, between the commuting experience and eudaimonic wellbeing, and between hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. We also found that commuting by public transport, walking and cycling is more likely to improve the quality of the commuting experience, and both hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. In terms of policy implications, policymakers and transport planners should, therefore, promote people's well-being by prioritising the development of sustainable transport, and encouraging greater use of public transport and active travel.}

However, conventional measurements of accessibility cannot capture individual experiences and perceptions of accessibility. Moreover, since many daily necessities and services can only be acquired online during the pandemic, the ease of using smartphone-based services play an essential role in people's everyday lives.Therefore, this paper investigates the relationship between the ease of using smartphone-based services, perceived accessibility, and perceived transport equity during the pandemic. Based on 186 family interviews, a panel survey with 569 respondents was conducted monthly from February to October 2020 in Kunming, China, and a three-wave cross-lagged panel model was developed to understand the causal relationship between the three constructs. The results indicate that the ease of using smartphone-based services dominantly influence transport equity in the early phase of the pandemic, but its effect faded after the lifting of travel restrictions. Perceived accessibility to services appears a sound indicator for transport equity in the new normal, but perceived accessibility and transport equity are not strongly associated when staying at home is perceived as desirable. Moreover, we found that contemporary practices of smartphone-based new mobility services only favour those who already have convenient access to services and have further excluded and marginalised disadvantaged populations, which urgently require policy interventions.}

Existing approaches often simplify their measure of proximity by using large areal units and by imposing arbitrary distance thresholds. By doing so, these approaches risk overlooking vulnerable, access-poor populations - the very populations that such studies are often trying to identify. These limitations are primarily motivated by computational constraints. However, recent advances in computational power, open data, and open-source analytics permit high-resolution proximity analyses on large scales. Given the impetus for equitable accessibility in our communities, this is of fundamental importance for researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages these open source advances to (a) measure proximity using network distance at the building level, (b) estimate population at that level, and (c) present the resulting distributions so vulnerable populations can be identified. Using three cities and modes of transport, we demonstrate how the approach enhances existing measures and identifies service-poor populations where the previous methods fall short. The proximity results could be used alone, or as inputs to access metrics. Our collating of these components into an open source code provides opportunities for researchers and practitioners to explore fine-resolution, city-wide accessibility across multiple cities and the host of questions that follow.}

We analyze spatial behavior of heterosexual married couples in Southern California based on the 2012 California Household Travel Survey and find that households living in areas with greater regional accessibility and neighborhood walkability have smaller, more centered, and more compact activity spaces overall compared to households in less compact areas, and that married pairs living in more accessible areas have greater equality in the size and centeredness of their activity spaces. We account for residential selection bias in our multivariate analysis and find that a ten unit increase in near-residence Walk Score was associated with a 12-18\% decrease in activity space size, a 6-8\% decrease in residential distancing, and a 12-13\% increase in spatial concentration for both men and women. Men and women, however, had significantly different activity space behaviors regardless of their neighborhood type. Compared to women, men on average had larger activity spaces and conducted their activities farther from home. Overall, results support our hypothesis that compact development provides married couples greater flexibility in how they divide household out-of-home activities by making destinations more convenient and lowering the overall spatial fixity of these activities. Future research and planning efforts should carefully consider which aspects of compact, accessible development are most effective for a given local context.}

  abstract = {Health policies seek to promote access to health care and should provide appropriate geographical accessibility to each demographical functional group. The dispersal demand of health-care services and the provision for such services at fixed locations contribute to the growth of inequality in their access. Therefore, the optimal distribution of health facilities over the space/area can lead to accessibility improvements and to the mitigation of the social exclusion of the groups considered most vulnerable. Requiring for such, the use of planning practices joined with accessibility measures. However, the capacities of Geographic Information Systems in determining and evaluating spatial accessibility in health system planning have not yet been fully exploited. This paper focuses on health-care services planning based on accessibility measures grounded on the network analysis. The case study hinges on mainland Portugal. Different scenarios were developed to measure and compare impact on the population's accessibility. It distinguishes itself from other studies of accessibility measures by integrating network data in a spatial accessibility measure: the enhanced two-step floating catchment area. The convenient location for health-care facilities can increase the accessibility standards of the population and consequently reduce the economic and social costs incurred. Recently, the Portuguese government implemented a reform that aimed to improve, namely, the access and equity in meeting with the most urgent patients. It envisaged, in terms of equity, the allocation of 89 emergency network points that ensured more than 90\% of the population be within 30 min from any one point in the network. Consequently, several emergency services were closed, namely, in rural areas. This reform highlighted the need to improve the quality of the emergency care, accessibility to each care facility, and equity in their access. Hence, accessibility measures become an efficient decision-making tool, despite its absence in effective practice planning. According to an application of this type of measure, it was possible to verify which levels of accessibility were decreased, including the most disadvantaged people, with a larger time of dislocation of 12 min between 2001 and 2011.Plain Language Summary Equitable access to health services is a critical goal for overcoming health disparities, and many reform efforts have been carried out worldwide to improve equity. This case study from Portugal, using geospatial analysis of public transportation access points and health services, shows that, in this case, reform efforts failed because they did not take into account connection times between where people live, where transport hubs are, and where emergency services are delivered.},

Although most cohesion studies are constrained to the analysis of regional disparities in economic indicators, this approach can be broadened to include other regional performance indicators. One of these indicators could be accessibility measures, from the point of view that accessibility, representing a competitive advantage of locations, constitutes a "desirable good" closely related to the welfare of each region. This paper suggests using changes in the spatial distribution of accessibility as a proxy to assess regional cohesion effects of transport infrastructure investments. However, as the conclusions taken depend heavily on the formulation of the accessibility measure, we recommend computing a set of accessibility indicators and analysing their results in a complementary way. The proposed methodology is tested by assessing regional cohesion effects of the large-scale road and rail transport infrastructure investments carried out in Spain in the period 1992-2004. The results obtained show that cohesion has improved for the road mode, while regional disparities have increased for the rail mode. This paper identifies the main factors driving this final cohesion effect and explores the strengths and weaknesses of the different accessibility indicators that were considered. The approach suggested in this paper has the potential to be applied in transport planning processes, and may eventually complement existing strategic assessment methodologies.},

Low-income, minority, older adults residing in inner-city neighborhoods are largely transit dependent, rely significantly on walking for transportation, and thus have particular mobility needs. We used a mixed-methods approach that drew information from the California Household Travel Survey but also from direct interaction (through focus groups, interviews, and neighborhood walking audits) with 81 low-income, inner city-living older adults to understand their travel patterns and mobility challenges and needs. We find that despite some positive mobility indicators in the inner city (mixed-use environment, frequent bus service, and short travel distances), these elders face significant mobility challenges because of a deteriorated built environment, heavy traffic, homelessness, and crime. A limitation of this research is that the small sample did not allow the study of possible gender or race/ethnicity differentiation in the travel patterns and needs of older adults. Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely only on information from the census and other aggregate data sources to understand the mobility needs of older adults but should complement this information with direct interaction with the communities for which they are planning. Although some social problems limiting the mobility of older adults are difficult to tackle, environmental and streetscape improvements can significantly enhance their mobility.}

Information from patient registers was combined with details of general practitioner surgery locations, road network characteristics, bus routes and community transport services, and a geographical information system (GIs) was used to calculate measures of accessibility to surgeries by public and private transport. Outcome measures included car travel times and indicators of the extent to which bus services could be used to visit GP surgeries. These variables were aggregated for wards or parishes and then compared with socio-economic characteristics of the populations living in those areas. The results indicated that only 10\% of residents faced a car journey of more than 10 min to a GP. Some 13\% of the population could not reach general medical services by daily bus. For 5\% of the Population, the car journey to the nearest surgery was longer than 10 min and there was no suitable bus service each weekday. In the remoter rural parishes, the lowest levels of personal mobility and the highest health needs indicators were found in the places with no daytime bus service each weekday and no community transport. The overall extent of accessibility problems and the existence of inverse care law effects in some rural localities have implications for the NHS, which aims to provide an equitable service to people wherever they live. The research also demonstrates the potential of patient registers and GIs as research and planning tools, though the practical difficulties of using these data sources and techniques should not be underestimated.

However, understanding this is highly relevant for policymakers to understand the impacts of their transport decisions. These dimensions include the distribution of mobility and accessibility levels over particular areas or for specific population groups, as well as how this may affect various social outcomes, including their levels of participation, social inclusion and community cohesion. In response, we propose a method to assess the socially relevant accessibility impacts (SRAIs) of policies in some of these key dimensions. The method combines the use of underlying ethics principles, more specifically the theories of egalitarianism and sufficientarianism, in combination with accessibility-based analysis and the Lorenz curve and Gini index. We then demonstrate the method in a case study example. Our suggestion is that policymakers can use these ethical perspectives to determine the equity of their policies decisions and to set minimum standards for local transport delivery. This will help them to become more confident in the development and adoption of new decision frameworks that promote accessibility over mobility and which also disaggregate the costs and benefits of transport policies over particular areas or for specific under-served population groups.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to model the travel behaviour of socially disadvantaged population segments in the United Kingdom (UK) using the data from the UK National Travel Survey 2002–2010. This was achieved by introducing additional socioeconomic variables into a standard national-level trip end model (TEM) and using purpose-based analysis of the travel behaviours of certain key socially disadvantaged groups. Specifically the paper aims to explore how far the economic and social disadvantages of these individuals can be used to explain the inequalities in their travel behaviours.  The models demonstrated important differences in travel behaviours according to household income, presence of children in the household, possession of a driver’s license and belonging to a vulnerable population group, such as being disabled, non-white or having single parent household status. In the case of household income, there was a non-linear relationship with trip frequency and a linear one with distance travelled. The recent economic austerity measures that have been introduced in the UK and many other European countries have led to major cutbacks in public subsidies for socially necessary transport services, making results such as these increasingly important for transport policy decision-making. The results indicate that the inclusion of additional socioeconomic variables is useful for identifying significant differences in the trip patterns and distances travelled by low-income.},

In this context, it critiques UK policies to deliver social equity through transport programmes in light of its Climate Change Agenda and the identified need to significantly reduce traffic levels on UK roads.It identifies the potential synergy between these two policy ambitions, but argues that currently there is a serious policy conflict between these agendas within the UK policy framework. In the light of this conclusion, it offers some key recommendations on the best way forward, which it recommends must be based on the synergistic and integrated delivery of policies for social and environmental equity within the transport sector. It concludes by identifying the key challenges this implies for applied research in this area. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

What precisely constitutes transport poverty is not adequately articulated within academic, policy or infrastructure design literature. This paper aims to demonstrate how the different ways that academic studies and policy programmes have defined and recorded the problem of transport poverty is directly related to the ways in which it has been subsequently addressed in practice. The overall impression is one of inadequacy, fragmentation, inconsistency and tokenistic treatment of an issue that potentially affects anywhere between 10 to 90\% of all households, depending on which definition is used and which country is being considered. This suggests that it is a far greater problem than the transport profession has previously been prepared to recognise and one that requires its urgent attention given the continuing trends for mass migration, urbanisation and wealth concentration within and between the 'global north' and 'global south'.}

  abstract = {The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a growing interest amongst UK academics and policy makers in the issue of transport disadvantage and, more innovatively, how this might relate to growing concerns about the social exclusion of low income groups and communities. Studies (predominantly in the United Kingdom) began to make more explicit the links policy between poverty, transport disadvantage, access to key services and economic and social exclusion (see for example Church and Frost, 2000; TRaC, 2000; Lucas et al., 2001; Kenyon 2003; Kenyon et al., 2003; Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Raje, 2003).By 2003, the UK Social Exclusion Unit had published and its now internationally recognised report on this subject, which subsequently resulted in the development of a set of transport policy guidances to local authorities in England to deliver what is now commonly referred to as accessibility planning as part of their Local Transport Plans (Department for Transport, 2006). Since this time, researchers, policy makers and practitioners in several other countries became interested in adopting a social exclusion approach to transport planning, largely because of its utility in identifying the role of transport, land use planning and service delivery decisions in creating and reinforcing poverty and social disadvantage.Eight years on from the SEU report, we can begin to reflect on the extent to which a social exclusion approach to the research of transport disadvantage has been successful in opening up new avenues of research enquiry and/or identifying new theoretical perspectives and/or methodological approaches. The paper begins by briefly revisiting the basic theories and core definitions which underpin and inform a social exclusion perspective. It then considers how these have been translated and understood in terms of transport. Secondly, it considers some of the emergent empirical research of transport-related exclusion that has attempted to measure and model the interactions between transport and mobility inequalities and relational negative social outcomes. Thirdly, it offers observations on progress in some key areas of policy and practice, with specific reference to the UK and Australia. It concludes by suggesting how further progress might be made on this issue and considers whether the social exclusion agenda is still a relevant approach for achieving this. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Accessibility improvement and spatial inequality reduction caused by HSR would play a positive role in transportation development projects appraisal and help achieve the regional coordinated development. Our purpose is to assess how much improvement of economic potential accessibility can each city get from the HSR based on the existing highway and HSR networks, as well as the changes in spatial disparity and accessibility distribution patterns. Taking Liaoning Province as a case, this paper studies the spatial pattern and inequality of accessibility in two intercity transportation scenarios using a gravity-based model. The sensitivity analysis of the parameter and the test of different mass indicators are also conducted. The results show that cities in the central areas have better accessibility than peripheral areas. Cities in the peripheral areas and near the HSR lines tend to benefit more from HSR. The inequality of accessibility decreases a lot in cities with HSR access but only has a minor reduction on a whole scale.}

The index measures convenience of travel for work trips for advantaged and disadvantaged populations, based on travel speed, using a multimodal network that includes transit lines, stop locations, transit schedules, and pedestrian connections via the street network. Non-peak hour service is compared with peak hour service to determine the degree to which operating resources are concentrated in times that might have greater benefits to advantaged populations. Finally, accessibility to the transit system is compared in relation to the number of transit stops in neighborhoods and employment centers, and these figures are compared between advantaged and disadvantaged locations. The scores for these three components are combined to create a single measure of transit economic equity. Disadvantage is defined using criteria established in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The index is constructed in a way that balances a robust and meaningful measure of transit equity that is decipherable by practitioners so that they can assess the equity of their systems as well as how potential service changes affect equity.}

  abstract = {Background: Access to major services, often located in urban centres, is key to the realisation of numerous Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In Kenya, there are no up-to-date and localised estimates of spatial access to urban centres. The authors estimate the travel time to urban centres and identify marginalised populations for prioritisation and targeting. Methods: Urban centres were mapped from the 2019 Kenya population census and combined with spatial databases of road networks, elevation, land use and travel barriers within a cost-friction algorithm to compute travel time. Seven travel scenarios were considered: i) walking only (least optimistic), ii) bicycle only, iii) motorcycle only, iv) vehicle only (most optimistic), v) walking followed by motorcycle transport, vi) walking followed by vehicle transport, and vii) walking followed by motorcycle and then vehicle transport (most pragmatic). Mean travel time, and proportion of the population within 1-hour and 2-hours of the urban centres were summarized at sub-national units (counties) used for devolved planning. Inequities were explored and correlations between the proportion of the population within 1-hour of an urban centre and ten SDG indicators were computed. Results: A total of 307 urban centres were digitised. Nationally, the mean travel time was 4.5-hours for the walking-only scenario, 1.0-hours for the vehicle only (most optimistic) scenario and 1.5-hours for the walking-motorcycle-vehicle (most pragmatic) scenario. Forty-five per cent (21.3 million people) and 87\% (41.6 million people) of Kenya’s population resided within 1-hour of the nearest urban centre for the least optimistic and most pragmatic scenarios respectively. Over 3.2 million people were considered marginalised or living outside the 2-hour threshold in the pragmatic scenario, 16.0 million Kenyans for walking only, and 2.2 million for the most optimistic scenario. County-level spatial access was highly heterogeneous ranging between 8\%-100\% and 32\%-100\% of people within the 1-hour threshold for the least and most optimistic scenarios, respectively. Counties in northern and eastern parts of Kenya were generally most marginalised. The correlation coefficients for nine SDG indicators ranged between 0.45 to 0.78 and were statistically significant. Conclusion: Travel time to urban centres in Kenya is heterogeneous. Therefore, marginalised populations should be prioritised during resource allocation and policies should be formulated to enhance equitable access to public services and opportunities in urban areas.}

	abstract = {This paper is based on research being undertaken as part of the {AUNT} {SUE} (Accessibility and User Needs in Transport for Sustainable Urban Environments) research programme being carried out at University College London, London Metropolitan University and Loughborough University in Great Britain. As part of the research programme, a software tool {AMELIA} (A Methodology to Enhance Life by Increasing Accessibility) is being developed in the Centre for Transport Studies at University College London. The purpose of {AMELIA} is to help local planners determine whether their transport and related policies help increase social inclusion by seeing whether they allow more people to reach opportunities including shops, employment, leisure facilities, and medical and welfare centres taking into account various mobility guidelines and, where appropriate, the cost of implementing the policy. {AMELIA} is a policy-oriented user-friendly interface to a {GIS} (Geographic Information System) designed to allow local transport planners to examine their policies to see if they increase social inclusion. Using {AMELIA} requires the assembly of data on the mobility capabilities of the members of the group, their movement patterns or potential movement patterns, potential improvements to the environment to increase accessibility, and, optionally, the cost of implementing the improvements.  The purpose of this paper is to show how {AMELIA} can be used to examine the impact of policy actions on particular groups in society in order to increase their accessibility, so that they can reach more opportunities. Research has been carried out into ways of increasing access for elderly and disabled. In the paper, {AMELIA} is used to show the cost effectiveness of increasing walking accessibility for elderly people living in the city of St Albans in Hertfordshire, using the following policy actions:  1.	Putting in dropped kerbs at existing road crossings; 2.	Putting in more road crossings;  3.	Widening the pavement;  4.	Putting in benches so that people can rest; 5.	Improving street lighting;  6	Putting in more public toilets. The analysis suggests that the three policy actions of putting in more benches, improving the street lighting and putting in more public toilets, would be much more cost effective than the other three. The paper is concluded with discussion about the implications of the assumptions made in carrying out the work.},

The objective of this research was to identify the specific barriers to school students cycling to school for six intermediate schools and recommend interventions that are likely to be effective, acceptable to parents and schools and favourable to school students for each of the schools.  These specific barriers and solutions were then used to identify common themes, issues and solutions that might be considered at a national level, and give more confidence to those who are responsible for considering and acting on school cycling initiatives.  Four stages of data collection were carried out, including the collection of existing school travel information, site visits, interviews, focus groups and questionnaires.  In order to overcome barriers to cycling to school it is proposed that the development of genuinely safe and attractive school cycle networks, cycle training, effective bike storage and the continued implementation of slow zones around schools (or widespread lower speed limits) be implemented or given higher priority.}

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate a Canadian School Travel Planning (SIP) intervention, by examining child, family, and school-level characteristics that are associated with mode shift from driving to AST one year post-intervention. A secondary objective was to highlight which STP strategies were deemed effective by parents of those children who switched travel modes to AST.Methods: Schools (n=103) across Canada participated between January 2010 and March 2012. SIP committees implemented strategies to overcome school-specific AST barriers. Mode shift and child/ family demographics were assessed by a retrospective, cross-sectional parental survey (n=7827) one year after SW implementation. School level demographics were collected from school administrators. Binomial regression models were applied to examine child, family, and school-level characteristics related to mode shift from driving to AST.Results: Approximately 17\% of the sample reported driving less at one-year follow-up both in the morning and afternoon periods. Among these, the majority switched to AST in the morning (n=1002) and afternoon periods (n=995). Results from the regression analyses showed that students in higher elementary grades, living less than 3 km from school, attending urban and suburban schools, and attending schools situated in a medium income neighborhood were significantly more likely to change travel mode from driving to AST. Approximately 35\% of parents reported that infrastructure improvements and safety education were the most effective SIP strategies.Conclusion: The study findings highlight the potential of the SIP process in Canada in promoting mode shift from driving to AST. The findings demonstrate STPs may be more effective in some locations where conditions are conducive to mode change. This should inform the development of SIP school-selection criteria that may maximize already limited resources by recruiting schools most responsive to SIP.(C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Occasionally, transit agencies may consider a fare change to maintain operations or to attract more passengers. However, transit agencies do not usually consider the effect of such fare change on passengers' accessibility. This paper investigates that effect. A multinomial logit mode choice model is developed to measure the monetary value of transit users' travel time. Then, the cumulative opportunity measure of accessibility is used to examine the change in job accessibility after a recent transit fare increase in the city of Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada. The results show that the loss in job accessibility resulting from transit fare increase is inversely proportional to the length of the trip, given a flat fare structure. The findings of this paper should be kept in mind before a transit agency rethinks transit fare structures. For example, a transit agency could consider applying a zone-based fare structure as opposed to a flat fare structure to ensure better equity for all transit users.}

In our paper, we explore two innovations in different stages of development: Sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and space tourism. SUVs entrench an existing socio-technical system and reproduce problematic practices, while space tourism might create a whole new, unsustainable system. We make three contributions. First, we introduce ‘unsustainabilities’ as a new term for technologies, institutions and practices that make, or keep, societies less sustainable. With this we direct attention to developments and structures that undermine ongoing sustainability transitions. Second, we distinguish unsustainabilities associated with socio-technical configurations, socio-technical systems, and meta-structures (spanning multiple systems). Third, we argue that precautionary policies will be needed in early stages of innovation, when there is still room to avoid unsustainable transitions.},

   abstract = {The long-term reliability and functioning of transportation systems will increasingly need to consider and plan for climate change and extreme weather events. Transportation systems have largely been designed and operated for historical climate conditions that are now often exceeded. Emerging knowledge of how to plan for climate change largely embraces risk-based thinking favoring more robust infrastructure designs. However, there remain questions about whether this approach is sufficient given the uncertainty and non-stationarity of the climate, and many other driving factors affecting transportation systems (e.g., funding, rapid technological change, population and utilization shifts, etc.). This paper examines existing research and knowledge related to the vulnerability of the transportation system to climate change and extreme weather events and finds that there are both direct and indirect “pathways of disruption.” Direct pathways of disruption consist of both abrupt impacts to physical infrastructure and impacts via non-physical factors such as human health, behavior, and decision making. Similarly, indirect pathways of disruption result from interconnections with other critical infrastructure and social systems. Currently, the direct pathways appear to receive much of the focus in vulnerability and risk assessments, and the predominant approach for addressing these pathways of disruption emphasizes strengthening and armoring infrastructure (robustness) guided by risk analysis. However, our analysis reveals that indirect pathways of disruption can have meaningful impacts, while also being less amenable to robustness-based approaches. As a result, we posit that concepts like flexibility and agility appear to be well suited to complement the status quo of robustness by addressing the indirect and non-physical pathways of disruption that often prove challenging - thereby improving the resilience of transportation systems.},

This paper uses mobility data from the city of Medellin, Colombia, to examine the role of local accessibility and the proximate scale in the city's everyday mobility. The analysis aimed at testing whether significant efforts on improving local conditions and fostering local mobility would help to improve social exclusion and transport disadvantage situations by alleviating the need of motorized and long-distance transport. Unlike most traditional analysis, proximity is not defined by Euclidian distance but instead using travel and modal choice variables. Results show the relevance of socioeconomic variables at determining travel behaviors as well as the importance of local accessibility for social groups in situations of transport disadvantage.}

We conducted a survey in February 2018, using a face-to-face questionnaire consisted of three parts that were relevant to our study: facing a discrete choice experiment, rating a set of indicators of latent variables, and reporting the main socioeconomic characteristics. We estimated a hybrid discrete choice (HDC) model to identify the socioeconomic characteristics affecting personal autonomy and perceived accessibility and also test the hypothesis that these latent variables are determinants in the choice process of urban transportation mode for people with mobility impairments.Results: The empirical results demonstrate that perceived accessibility is different for travelers with a low income, wheelchair users, mobility impairments caused by aging and transit dependents. We also find that personal autonomy varies depending on car owners, permanent mobility impairments, wheelchair users, and workers in comparison with other people. The population heterogeneity we obtained through the latent variables allows us to identify policies to improve the quality of life for people with mobility impairments.Conclusions: This paper advances the knowledge of how tangible and latent attributes affect the transportation choice process for people with mobility impairments by estimating an HDC model that integrates waiting time, travel time, urban transportation costs, personal autonomy, and perceived accessibility. Our results also contribute to a better understanding of the transportation needs of people with mobility impairments in developing countries.}

This is particularly an issue with street trees in urban contexts, which are known to provide economic, environmental, and livability benefits but are also widely considered a road safety detriment.This research relies upon advances in remote sensing to map both tree canopy and street-tree locations in GIS for the entirety of the city and county of Denver, Colorado. We then statistically test the association between street trees and seven years of road safety outcomes while controlling for factors known to be associated with crash outcomes.Despite fifty years as standard design practice, our results suggest that the expected safety benefit of roadside clear zones - at least with respect to street trees in an urban context - may be overstated. In fact, larger tree canopies that extend over the street are associated with fewer injury/fatal crashes as well as fewer crashes overall while holding all other variables constant. The number of street trees per mile associates with improved safety in wealthier neighborhoods but can be detrimental in low-income neighborhoods; this inconsistency represents an equity issue in need of future research. When assessing the safety impact of street trees in the clear zone, municipalities and transportation agencies need to be more cognizant of how street design may impact road user behaviors, particularly related to issues that directly affect safety such as travel speeds and driver awareness.}

The purpose of the Section 5311 program is to improve mobility for economically disadvantaged rural residents.  In practice, states exercise considerable discretion over the operation of the program, including establishing eligibility criteria and funding levels for individual operators.  Forty-one states grant monies to operators through a competitive process based on applications. The applications are used to rank operators according to one or more performance measures.  States often employ scoring techniques in their evaluations.  The remaining nine states award subsidies according to formulas.  There are great similarities in state goals for rural transit service even though there is significant variation in the amounts of monies awarded to comparable operators.  To better realize the purpose of the Section 5311 program, states might consider adopting an allocation procedure whereby monies are awarded using a formula based on equalizing the subsidy per passenger trip.  States that establish minimum rural mobility standards could split their total allocation into two categories, apportioning one part by population and the other by the subsidy per passenger trip.}

That distribution, we propose, is one where the maximum gap between the lowest and highest accessibility, both by mode and in space, should be limited, while attempting to maximize average access. We then review transportation planning practice for a priori distributional goals and find little explicit guidance in conventional and even justice-oriented transportation planning and analyses.

  abstract = {Because of the ageing of the population, over the coming decades the transportation system will have to be adapted to the needs of an increasing number of persons with travel impairments. More than acknowledged in the past, this underlines the key challenge for transportation planning to design a transportation system that guarantees access for all population groups, irrespective of the features of a person’s body. This will require substantial investments, as the existing transportation system has historically been designed to serve able-bodied persons with little attention for its usability by persons with varying types of impairments. The aim of the paper is to develop a basic framework that can be helpful to set priorities towards the development of an inclusive transportation system. The framework distinguishes two principles for priority setting, one derived from the principle of welfare maximization and the other from the notion of ‘hardship’. Based on these two principles of priority setting, three different types of measures to remove mobility barriers for mobility impaired persons are distinguished: (1) measures that live up to the principle of efficiency or welfare maximization; (2) measures that reduce accessibility hardship through an improvement of the mainstream transportation system transport; and (3) measures that reduce accessibility hardship through dedicated services for persons with travel impairments. In order to assess and rank these measures, cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis should be adapted to capture benefits and effects that are relevant for travel impaired persons.}

Sanction-based models, which dominate current thinking about managing criminals, have negative consequences for the individual wrongdoer and for society.

We present a simple framework of how to move from a general conceptualization of a benefit or burden to a more precise definition of suitable individual variables that can be subjected to an equity analysis. The assessment of equity also hinges on the identification of different population groups, along multiple dimensions that can represent advantage or disadvantage: income, gender, age, ethnicity, ability, and residential location. We end the chapter with an overview of the linchpin of an equity indicator: an explicit normative standard specifying what is desirable and what is not. Taken together, these three components are the ingredients of the equity indicators presented in the remaining chapters of this book.},

This availability has been shown to be higher in neighborhoods with lower socio-economic status (SES). The aim of this study was to examine inequalities in alcohol outlet density and proximity around schools by area-level SES in Madrid, Spain. Data on schools, SES, alcohol outlets and population density at census tract level were obtained through public databases from the local government of Madrid. We examined (1) density as the number of alcohol outlets around schools within 3 buffers (i.e. 200 m, 400 m and 800 m) and (2) proximity as the distance from schools to their nearest alcohol outlet. We performed multilevel analyses to examine the associations between alcohol outlet density and proximity and SES, adjusted by population density. Secondary schools (n = 576) located in less deprived areas had lower densities of alcohol outlets at walking distances of 200 and 400 m (50\% and 37\% lower, respectively p {$<$} 0.05). No significant differences were found for the proximity measures. The socioeconomic level of the area in which adolescents go to school is a determinant of their exposure to alcohol, where those who study in high SES areas have lower exposure to alcohol outlets. This study highlights the need to prioritize equity in the design and implementation of policies to limit alcohol accessibility among adolescents, including establishing minimum distances between schools and alcohol outlets or limiting the number of outlets per inhabitant in neighborhoods.},

Typically, travel time (or distance) is used as a measure for accessibility “through” transit. In recent studies, researchers pointed out that transit fare could be an obstacle to accessibility. For example, El-Geneidy (2016) suggested that travel cost (i.e. the transit fare one pays) would also influence accessibility through transit. In addition, a more recent study suggested that an increase in transit flat fare would result in a loss in accessibility. Such loss was found to be inversely proportional to the length of the trips (i.e. substantial for short trips and unworthy for long trips), which can be considered “unfair” for short-trip users (Ma et al., 2017).  This study expands on Ma et al. (2017) and constructs a fair-fare structure for improved passengers’ accessibility. It is assumed that a transit agency needs to introduce a new fare policy that will cover its increasing capital and operating costs. A pre-determined loss of accessibility is set for all short, medium, and long trips; and a new fare structure is established accordingly. The City of Kelowna, BC, is selected as a case study.}

  abstract = {Despite public bicycle sharing programs (PBSP) gaining global attention as important climate smart transport strategy to support sustainable, low carbon societies in European and North American cities, its uptake in Asia, except for China, has been unexpectedly limited. Moreover, while existing schemes in other regions could provide a better understanding about bicycle sharing, the need to improve our understanding of PBSP’s role in catering for the local transportation mobility and accessibility needs and requirements as well as identifying strategies to make PBSP better adapted to local Asian condition is in order. To date, there has been limited information and analytics to inform low-carbon local planning especially from the perspective of variious individuals. To address this gap, this paper aims to advance the understanding of bike sharing schemes in Asia by examining motivators, constraints and opportunities, and their contribution towards achieving sustainable urban mobility outcomes. Using a survey-based research design approach, this study examines the perception of various individuals on the perceived benefits, and identify factors which have facilitated or constrained the implementation of PBSP. In essence, results show that technical constraints were perceived to be the most restrictive and dominant barriers while there is general consensus that different types of facilitators support bikeshare implementation; also, environmental benefits top the list of benefits while the lowest scorer is economic benefit, providing vital and important information to inform design, marketing and communication strategies for PBSP implementation within the Asian setting. This paper enhances our understanding of the challenges involved in bikeshare implementation as a first step in planning for a smarter society. It also attempts to build the evidence base to comprehend the localization of bike sharing schemes. Understanding how PBSP can be locally implemented can have long-term positive effects through creating a cycling culture and changing peoples’ travel behaviors.},

Also, they present a strikingly different set of challenges and opportunities in their pedestrian environments. The need to enhance our understanding of environmental attributes, which encourage pedestrians to participate (or not) in walking and walking-related activities, has prompted this pedestrian-scale face-to-face questionnaire survey on one developing city. This paper has three aims, namely: examine the pedestrian decision making process, apply the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to empirically define the hierarchy of pedestrian needs (criteria), and examine the relative priorities of environmental attributes (alternatives) that satisfy the pedestrian needs, with the end goal of realising a positive walking environment. A total of 70 respondents were collected via face-to-face questionnaire survey which was rolled out in the Quiapo District (Manila, Philippines). Results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of AHP in supporting an evidence-based approach to defining the pedestrian need hierarchy. Moreover, it established that the most important criteria is protection rather than mobility. Traditionally, the design of pedestrian facilities (e.g. sidewalks/pathways) was premised on the need to move. Moreover, based on the survey, the relative priority of the criteria in the order of most important to least important priority is: protection, ease, equitable access, mobility, identity and enjoyment. This comprises the pedestrian need-hierarchy, which served as the theoretical framework of this paper. This paper presents an alternative approach at quantifying qualitative criteria and attributes that served relevant to the pedestrian decision-making process. Moreover, this research sheds light on the importance of a user-centred needs-assessment approach to better understand pedestrian decision-making and behaviour.

This paper proposes a novel, disaggregated approach to investigating vulnerability to such increases at the household level. We propose a set of indicators of 'car-related economic stress' (ORES), based on individual household level expenditure data for the UK, to identify which low-income households spend disproportionately on running motor vehicles, and to assess the depth of their economic stress. By subsequently linking the dataset to local fuel price data, we are able to model the disaggregated price elasticities of car fuel demand. This provides us with an indicator of each household's adaptive capacity to fuel price increases. The findings show that 'Low Income, High Cost' households (LIHC) account for 9\% of UK households and have distinct socio-demographic characteristics. Interestingly, they are characterised by very low responses to fuel price increases, which may cause them to compromise on other important areas of their household expenditures. Simulations suggest that a 20\% increase in fuel prices would substantially increase the depth, but not the incidence of CRES. Overall, the study sheds light on a sector of the population with high levels of vulnerability to fuel price increases, owing to high exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity. This raises challenges for social, environmental and resilience policy in the transport sector.}

The negative impacts of fuel price spikes in terms of increased household expenditure and economic stress are unevenly spatially and socially distributed. Previous research has found that vulnerability to fuel price increases is higher in peripheral, pen-urban and rural areas, and that low income tends to be co-located with high car dependence and low vehicle fuel efficiency, with a compounding effect on vulnerability. The goal of this article is to test these hypotheses for England, providing new evidence on spatial patterns of vulnerability to fuel price increases at the small-area level. We propose a composite vulnerability indicator combining data on income, accessibility, vehicle inspection and vehicle registration for 2011. Within English city-regions, we find little evidence of the socially regressive patterns previously identified in the literature. This is explained by the persistent concentration of poverty in urban cores, as well as by the poor fuel economy of the vehicle fleet in wealthier areas, due to the prevalence of powerful vehicles there. On the other hand, our analysis suggests that the impacts of fuel price increases would be very unequal between city-regions, as the least sensitive metropolitan area (Greater London) is also characterised by high levels of adaptive capacity. We conclude by setting out an agenda for future research on spatial vulnerability to fuel price increases.}

Similarly, while in sparse areas most households without cars are either virtually immobile or reliant on car lifts, in large urban areas the 'mobility gap' between car-owning and carless households is considerably smaller, as the latter are able to use modal alternatives to the car. These findings are interpreted with reference to an integrated theoretical framework, showing how changes in land use and the environmental and social impacts of increasing motorization are intimately linked. Notably, the consequences of the self-reinforcing cycle of car dependence on two forms of car-related transport disadvantage (car deprivation and forced car ownership) are highlighted. Overall, the article highlights how the socio-demographic composition and the travel behaviour of carless households vary systematically across different types of area: this has interesting implications for sustainable transport policy and research.},

Since the provision of public open space in Melbourne is guided by the Victoria Planning Provisions (VPP), this article also demonstrates the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a tool to compare the current distribution of public open space with policy. Measures of distance to, and size of, the closest public open space were derived using GIS and analysed according to area-level socio-economic disadvantage. A novel method of estimating public open space access points is introduced.Over one-third of dwellings in metropolitan Melbourne were located in areas that did not align with the VPP public open space proximity standard; however, we found no evidence of a socio-economic gradient in terms of compliance. There were statistically significant differences between disadvantaged and advantaged areas with respect to proximity to, and size of, public open space. However, while the differences were statistically significant the magnitudes of the differences were small. Future research needs to investigate how different measures (e.g. quality, size) can be included in planning regulations to support equitable provision of public open space.}

These projects were included in the respective regional operational programs co-financed by the European Union (EU) and national funds. The paper discusses the EU's regional and cohesion policy which aims at reducing regional inequalities and ensuring social, economic and territorial cohesion. In Greece, cohesion policy implementation for the 2007-2013 period was achieved through the NSRF, 2007-2013, whose training philosophy and the priorities that it set are the focus of the present study. The research area concerns the region of eastern Macedonia and Thrace and, more specifically, the 21 municipalities that it consists of. One of the main conclusions of the study is that public expenditure on the projects is directly associated with the area covered by the municipalities, as well as with the length of the road network improved. However, no correlation with the population of municipalities or the gross domestic product (GDP) of each regional unit has been observed. Our findings suggest that decisions for efficient allocation of infrastructure resources in a region by policy makers should not be based on single characteristics such as regional population density, but rather on more complex considerations, such as existing natural resources, geomorphological characteristics and location.

  abstract = {The concept of accessibility - the ease with which people can reach places or opportunities - lies at the heart of what makes cities livable, workable and sustainable. As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and 'smart' urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surrey's growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surrey's multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups - children and youth (0-19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) - we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the city's hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to similar to 9000 and similar to 124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 min by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as similar to 8000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the city's schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people - almost half of them seniors - will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 min by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities. Our study highlights how open-source data and code can be leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis of accessibility demand across a city, which is key for ensuring inclusive and 'smart' urban investment strategies.},

Despite their integration, most studies of road safety dichotomize urban and rural places, and studies have consistently demonstrated that rural places are more dangerous for motorists than urban places. Our study investigates whether these findings are sensitive to the definition of urban and rural. We use three different definitions of urban-rural continua to quantify and compare motor vehicle occupant fatality rates per person-trip and person-mile for the state of Wisconsin. The three urban-rural continua are defined by: (1) popular impressions of urban, suburban, and rural places using a system from regional economics; (2) population density; and (3) the intensity of commute flows to core urbanized areas. In this analysis, the three definitions captured different people and places within each continuum level, highlighting rural heterogeneity. Despite this heterogeneity, the three definitions resulted in similar fatality rate gradients, suggesting a potentially latent "rural" characteristic. We then used field observations of urban-rural transects to refine the definitions. When accounting for the presence of higher-density towns and villages in rural places, we found that low-density urban places such as suburbs and exurbs have fatality rates more similar to those in rural places. These findings support the need to understand road safety within the context of regional development processes instead of urban-rural categories. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

With data from a survey of residents of Nova Scotia, Canada, it develops a random-parameters ordered probit model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable. The approach extends current research by including built environment and attitudinal variables in the model along with daily travel behaviour, and by observing heterogeneous effects of variables at the individual level. The study results reinforce the evidence that daily out-of-home travel has a positive impact on life satisfaction by facilitating access to fulfilling daily activities such as work and social events, and that being physically active positively affects life satisfaction. The results suggest that having greater access to varied modes of transportation generally improves life satisfaction. Results on the built environment and attitudes indicate that living closer to a park or sports field is positively related to life satisfaction. Being community-minded is also generally related to higher life satisfaction. The results reveal that heterogeneity exists in the sample; for instance, attitudes toward being community-minded showed a statistically significant standard deviation in the model. Insights from this study will guide effective transportation policymaking for healthy communities.}

However, mostly due to cost and difficulty in collecting georeferenced data and characteristics of grocery stores, the USDA Food Access Research Atlas is infrequently released, and considers only income, vehicle ownership, and distance to the nearest grocery store. In this paper, we explored the feasibility of a crowdsourced geospatial data source, coupled with additional measures, in supplementing the USDA's current designation of food deserts. We used Yelp data to map food deserts in the city of Dallas and compared them with those based on the 2015 USDA food retailer database. Although direct comparison was not possible due to time mismatch between the two data sources, the discrepancies highlighted the need of a more frequent identification of food deserts for timely policy intervention. Furthermore, we extended mapping to reveal other potential areas of concerns, by adding the Transit Score metric and Yelp's price descriptor of businesses. The resulting maps illustrated the areas with grocery stores nearby but with limited accessibility due to lack of public transit or potential financial barriers in purchasing foods due to high prices. Our findings demonstrate the current status and future potential of up-to-date crowdsourced, georeferenced data as a complement of official government data, which could serve to extend food access research and guide health policies.},

Results indicated that there is tension around what constitutes meaningful transportation equity work. Key findings centered around a distinction between ?performative? equity work and ?authentic? equity work. Performative equity work privileges the comfort and perspective of dominant groups, reinforces the status quo, stays in the realm of the rhetoric, and often results in superficial changes only. Authentic equity work centers the experience of Black people and people of color, embraces discomfort, transforms dominant culture, and results in measurable changes to the lives of those historically oppressed. Key recommendations include supporting action-oriented equity work, especially around resource allocation and redistribution of decision-making power to communities.

  abstract = {Urban greenspace can improve the health of local residents by facilitating physical activity, psychological restoration, and social contacts, as well as through amelioration of the physical environment and immune system modulation. In some cases, greenspace exposure has been reported to reduce health inequalities associated with deprivation. However, studies investigating the socioeconomic equity of greenspace distribution find conflicting results. We investigate how greenspace distribution varies with socioeconomic deprivation in Sheffield, UK, for three aspects of greenspace distribution (access; provision, or accessible greenspace area; and population pressure, or potential for crowding), and for three types of greenspace (any publicly accessible greenspace; greenspaces meeting criteria that increase the likelihood of providing health benefits; and greenspaces with specific provision for children and young people). We find that the accessibility of greenspace favours people living in more deprived areas, although the total area provided is not proportionally greater, and greenspaces have a greater potential for crowding. When looking only at high quality greenspaces, the relationship with deprivation is far weaker, although the potential for crowding remains greater in more deprived areas. When looking only at greenspaces with provision for children and young people, accessibility once again favours people in more deprived areas, but the total area provided is less and the potential for congestion is greater. Our results are influenced by the historic choice of locations for urban parks in Sheffield, i.e. within walking distance of working class neighbourhoods. Both methodological details and local historic context are key drivers of whether greenspace distribution is equitable within cities, and increasing the complexity of questions being asked also increases the complexity of results. Researchers should carefully consider which aspects of equity are of interest when designing studies. We recommend that planners and policy makers ensure that greenspaces are designed and maintained to a high standard that meets the cultural, recreational and accessibility needs of urban residents, including those belonging to minorities, in order to provide maximal public health benefits.}

This research has three aims including two main aims and one intermediate aim. The two main aims were to identify variables that explain why the perceived walking time to school (PWTS) is below or above a threshold and to examine the role of PWTS as well as socioeconomic status, household factors, parental attitudes towards walking and walking safety on active school travel among children. The intermediate aim was to identify a threshold for the PWTS. This threshold may provide information about how to plan transport and roads around schools. Data were gathered in Rasht, Iran in 2014. The 1078 questionnaires were distributed among pupils aged 7-9 years in nine schools. The children were instructed to bring the forms to their parents who completed them (n=735, return rate=80\%). To predict active school travel (0= inactive modes, 1=active modes), and PWTS (0=long, 1= short) two binary logistic regression analyses were carried out. Results showed that a 10 minutes PWTS was the threshold where the proportion of active mode use (walking) starts to decrease compared to the best performing alternative mode. Higher parental age (OR=1.02) and household income (OR=1.27), accessibility to public transport (OR=0.42), attending public school (OR=0.36), access to school service (OR=0.45) and contextual and design preconditions for walking (OR=0.81) were associated with PWTS to eligible schools. PWTS (OR=15.24) was a strong negative predictor of active school travel. Mother's driving license (OR=0.49), more owned cars (OR=0.53), higher mother's educational degree (OR=0.74), accessibility to public transport (OR=0.26), and access to school service (OR=0.22) were related to active school travel. This research found that PWTS is the most important barrier for children's active travelling while adjusting for a wide-range of demographics, socio-economic variables as well as safety and attitude factors in Iran.

   abstract = {Introduction Subjective wellbeing is a topic that has attracted considerable attention in the transportation literature in recent years. As a result, there is a burgeoning literature that investigates the impacts of travel on subjective wellbeing, and how wellbeing, in turn, can influence behavior. An important aspect of subjective wellbeing are the affective reactions of people to their experiences. Objective The objective of this paper is to analyze the affective reactions of travelers with respect to various modes of transportation. In particular, we are interested in the potential for dissonance between primary mode of travel and the mode(s) of travel identified as evoking various affective reactions. Materials and methods The study is based on data collected from a sample of travelers in the city of Santiago, in Chile. Participants in the study were asked about their usual mode of travel, and then were asked to name their ideal mode(s) of transportation from the perspective of various affective reactions. The reactions we investigate are associated with the values of Freedom, Enjoyment, Happiness, Poverty, Luxury, and Status. Analysis is based on tests of independence and visualization techniques. Results The results indicate that users of public transportation experience the most dissonance in terms of affective reactions, and active travelers the least. For those travelers who experience dissonance, active travel is the mode most commonly associated with Freedom, Enjoyment, and Happiness, while public transportation is most commonly associated with Poverty. The automobile, in contrast, is the mode most commonly associated with Luxury and Status.},

More is needed to be known about this relationship.  What was done in the first of two studies of transit ridership in Dade County is reported and what was learned of relevance to transit-oriented development is summarized.  Bus mode share by place of residence proved primarily dependent on automobile ownership and secondarily on jobs-housing balance and bus service frequency. Automobile ownership, in turn, proved dependent on household income, overall density, and transit access to downtown.  Thus, three types of variables--sociodemographic, land use, and transit service--were found to affect bus use through a web of interrelationships.  Likewise, bus mode share by place of work proved dependent on the cost of parking, transit access to downtown, and overall density, again through a web of interrelationships.  By using equations thus derived, densities required to support different levels of transit service and productivity were computed.  It takes 8.4 dwellings per acre to support 25-min headways at the transit operator's minimum productivity level and 19.4 dwellings per acre at the systemwide average productivity.  As household incomes, parking costs, or other local conditions vary from the county average, required densities rise or fall accordingly.  In any event, densities are likely to be well above the old industry standard of seven units per acre.}

The study also examined the case in Metro Manila where urban rail fares have been kept constant since 2000 amidst inflation and increase of non-rail public transport fares. This entailed estimations of station O-D (origin-destination) matrix using gravity model and passenger waiting time using queuing theory. It was found that although it is commendable in terms of fare affordability, it appears that the very low rail fares have increased rail demand beyond capacity, thus bringing about inequity in passenger overload delay.},

We make use of a detailed questionnaire of 187 questions from 2009 and 2012, aggregate responses into 14 indicators, and compare changes in quality of life between three transit developments zones (comunas), three non-intervention zones, and between income levels and gender. We find that equity improved overall across geographical zones, income, and gender, even as changes in specific quality of life dimensions varied.

Considering that the city is known worldwide as a reference of successful urban and transportation planning, the index application must confirm it. An additional objective of the study was to evaluate the index itself, or the subjacent assessment method and reference values. A global I\_SUM value of 0.747 confirmed that the city has indeed very positive characteristics regarding sustainable mobility policies. However, some deficiencies were also detected, particularly with respect to non-motorized transport modes. The application has also served to show that a few I\_SUM indicators were not able to capture some of the positive aspects of the city, what may suggest the need of changes in their formulation. Finally, the index application in parts of the city suggests that the city provides fair and equitable mobility conditions to all citizens throughout the city.

Buses are the most  popular means of transport catering to about 60\% of the total demand. In order to meet the  transport demand in Delhi, the State and the Union government started the construction  of a mass rapid transit system, including the Delhi Metro. By the application of various data  and public response, the paper accentuates the qualitative discussion on impacts of mass  rapid transit system (MRTS) corridor on land use and social aspects of lives of residents and  road users. It also proposes certain mitigating measures for that meticulous condition. The  analysis and survey outcome explain about the exceeded level of noise level as compared to  CPCB standards. The share of public transport in total noise pollution is smaller than private  but still exceeds the standards. Such problem demands the design of noise barrier along the  corridor to curb the noise pollution.}

  abstract = {The development of health care facilities in a nation improves the quality of life of its citizens, and enhances their efficiency and productivity; eventually, reducing poverty. This paper proposed a methodology that uses GIS and multi-criteria decision-making technique for development of health care units (HCUs), to attain spatial efficiency in the distribution of facilities. The methodology assigns spatial weightage to the suitability index of the candidate locations in the objective function of maximizing coverage location-allocation problem embedded in ArcGIS. Habitations unserved by the existing HCUs are considered as candidate locations. The five criteria considered to determine the suitability index of a location are: Access distance to nearest existing HCU (C1), Accessibility index of habitations to existing HCUs based on service to population ratio (C2), Connectivity to all-weather roads (C3), Population of neighborhood (C4), and Health care requirement of a zone (C5). The proposed methodology is applied in Jhunjhunu district, India as a case study, for the development of Community Health Centers (CHCs). Accessibility of habitation to facilities (jointly C1, C2, and C4) found to be the most influencing criteria in deciding the suitability of a candidate location to site the CHCs. The proposed methodology enables maximization of coverage, minimization of needless competition within CHCs, and satisfaction of the zonal requirement for health. Study findings would be helpful to national policymakers for developing HCUs by prioritizing fund allocation to shortage areas to improve the health index as well as the quality of life.}

The travel demand information is reflected into the MCA measure by evaluating and clustering PT and Private Vehicle Transportation (PVT) trip diaries. Both vertical and horizontal equities are measured for the network's Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZs). To redress the inequities, a priority list of operational recommendations for each TAZ is identified. The proposed method is tested with the Greater Melbourne area datasets and the TAZs with the highest inequity along with prescribed operational recommendations are identified. In terms of equitable distribution of public transportation service, a major observation from the case study model was that the outer suburban areas located in the eastern side of the the Melbourne metropolitan area are relatively underserved as compared to the inner and western suburbs.}

Some factors or fairness characteristics (FCs) strongly influence gender fairness in the transport system. The difference with previous studies, which focus on general concepts, is the incorporation of level 3 FCs, which are more detailed aspects or measures that can be implemented by companies or infrastructure managers and operators in order to increase fairness and inclusion in each use case. The aim of this paper is to find computational solutions, Bayesian networks, and analytic hierarchy processes capable of hierarchizing level 3 FCs and to predict by simulation their values in the case of applying some improvements. This methodology was applied to data from women in four use cases: railway transport, autonomous vehicles, bicycle sharing stations, and transport employment. The results showed that fairer railway transport requires increased personal space, hospitality rooms, help points, and helpline numbers. For autonomous vehicles, the perception of safety, security, and sustainability should be increased. The priorities for bicycle sharing stations are safer cycling paths avoiding hilly terrains and introducing electric bicycles, child seats, or trailers to carry cargo. In transport employment, the priorities are fair recruitment and promotion processes and the development of family-friendly policies.}

   abstract = {The objective of this paper is to investigate the attributes of walkable environments from the perspective of seniors in the Island of Montreal in Quebec, Canada. The research is based on a combination of statistical analysis of travel diary data and field work to conduct walkability audits. The approach follows a sequence of logical steps. The first step involves the estimation of a travel behavior model walking by seniors (people 65 years or older). The results of this model, in combination with cluster analysis, are used to identify sites where the model systematically under- or over-predicts walking. Subsequently, sites are targeted for walkability audits. It then becomes possible to assess the presence or absence of attributes of built environments where walking is more or less common than other factors would predict. A walkability audit of 403 street segments was used to proof the concept in this paper. The audited items were summarized in contingency tables and tested with the chi-squared test of independence to identify streetscape elements that correlate with walking for transportation.

However, we know very little about whether walkable neighborhoods promote walking among older adults, particularly those with lower incomes. Therefore in this paper we: (i) examine the relation between trip distance and socio-demographic attributes and accessibility features of lower income older adults in Metro Vancouver; and, (ii) implement a web-based application to calculate the accessibility of lower income older adults in Metro Vancouver based on their travel behavior. We use multilevel linear regression to estimate the determinants of trip length. We find that in this population distance traveled is associated with gender, living arrangements, and dog ownership. Furthermore, significant geographical variations (measured using a trend surface) were also found. To better visualize the impact of travel behavior on accessibility by personal profile and location, we also implemented a web-based calculator that generates an Accessibility (A)-score using Google Maps API v3 that can be used to evaluate the accessibility of neighborhoods from the perspective of older adults.

These improvements, which are due mainly to a rise in efficiency, produce locational advantages and increase the attractiveness of these cities, thereby possibly enhancing their competitiveness and economic growth. However, there may be equity issues at stake, as the main accessibility benefits are primarily concentrated in urban areas with a HSR station, whereas other locations obtain only limited benefits.HSR extensions may contribute to an increase in spatial imbalance and lead to more polarized patterns of spatial development. Procedures for assessing the spatial impacts of HSR must therefore follow a twofold approach which addresses issues of both efficiency and equity. This analysis can be made by jointly assessing both the magnitude and distribution of the accessibility improvements deriving from a HSR project.This paper describes an assessment methodology for HSR projects which follows this twofold approach. The procedure uses spatial impact analysis techniques and is based on the computation of accessibility indicators, supported by a Geographical Information System (GIS). Efficiency impacts are assessed in terms of the improvements in accessibility resulting from the HSR project, with a focus on major urban areas; and spatial equity implications are derived from changes in the distribution of accessibility values among these urban agglomerations.

  abstract = {Lengthy travel distances may explain why relatively few veterans in the United States use VG hospitals for inpatient medical/surgical care. We used two approaches to distinguish the effect of distance on VA use from other factors such as access to alternatives and veterans' characteristics. The first approach describes how disparities in travel distance to the VA are related to other characteristics of geographic areas. The second approach involved a multivariate analysis of VA use in postal zip code areas (ZCAs), We used several sources of data to estimate the number of veterans who had priority access to the VA so that use rates could be estimated. Access to hospitals was characterized by estimated travel distance to inpatient providers that typically serve each ZCA. The results demonstrate that travel distance to the VA is variable, with veterans in rural areas traveling much farther for VA care than veterans in areas of high population density. However, Medicare recipients also travel farther in areas of low population density. In some areas veterans must travel lengthy distances for VA care because VA hospitals which were built over the past few decades are not located close to areas in which veterans reside in the 1990s. The disparities in travel distance suggest inequitable access to the VA. Use of the VA decreases with increases in travel distance only up to about 15 miles, after which use is relatively insensitive to further increases in distance, The multivariate analyses indicate that those over 65 are less sensitive to distance than younger veterans, even though those over 65 are Medicare eligible and therefore have inexpensive access to alternatives. The results suggest that proximity to a VA hospital is only one of many factors determining VA use, Further research is indicated to develop an appropriate response to the needs of the small but apparently dedicated group of VA users who are traveling very long distances to obtain VA care.

   abstract = {Some studies have estimated fatality and injury rates for bus occupants, but data was aggregated at the country level and made no distinction between bus types. Also, injured pedestrians and cyclists, as a result of bus travel, were overlooked. We compared injury rates for car and city bus occupants on specific urban major roads, as well as the cyclist and pedestrian injuries associated with car and bus travel. We selected ten bus routes along major urban arterials (in Montreal, Canada). Passenger-kilometers traveled were estimated from vehicle counts at intersections (2002–2010) and from bus passenger counts (2008). Police accident reports (2001–2010) provided injury data for all modes. Injury rates associated with car and bus travel were calculated for vehicle occupants, pedestrians, and cyclists. Injury rate ratios were also computed. The safety benefits of bus travel, defined as the number of vehicle occupant, cyclist, and pedestrian injuries saved, were estimated for each route. Overall, for all ten routes, the ratio between car and bus occupant injury rates is 3.7 (95% CI [3.4, 4.0]). The rates of pedestrian and cyclist injuries per hundred million passenger-kilometers are also significantly greater for car travel than that for bus travel: 4.1 (95% CI [3.5, 4.9]) times greater for pedestrian injuries; 5.3 (95% CI [3.8, 7.6]) times greater for cyclist injuries. Similar results were observed for fatally and severely injured vehicle occupants, cyclists, and pedestrians. At the route level, the safety benefits of bus travel increase with the difference in injury rate associated with car and bus travel but also with the amount of passenger-kilometers by bus. Results show that city bus is a safer mode than car, for vehicle occupants but also for cyclists and pedestrians traveling along these bus routes. The safety benefits of bus travel greatly vary across urban routes; this spatial variation is most likely linked to environmental factors. Understanding the safety benefits of public transit for specific transport routes is likely to provide valuable information for mobilizing city and transportation planners.},

Despite proposing several indices, measuring land-use mixedness has always struggled with complexities such as determining land-use priorities, distance, and attributes, which needs a robust framework to consider for ideal mixed-ness and being improved constantly. By combining both divisional and integral indices, this paper has proposed a multi-component novel measure, which considers quantity, importance, distance, and balance in land-uses mixture along streets as main corridors of the daily commute in Tehran, Iran; named Mixed-use Distribution Index (MUDI). First, the measure calculates indices for land-use combination (LWC) and residential to non-residential land-uses (RR) in equal street sections. Then, the Gini index with some innovative spatial manipulation was applied to capture the evenness of ideal values of each index among streets' sections. Finally, the MUDI of the street was achieved by averaging two Gini indices. Comparing Gini and MUDI values with current characteristics of the case study, accessibility level, and allocation of some land-uses claims for the measure's reliability to employ in land-use planning evaluations.}

Compliance is set by the Australian Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport (DSAPT, 2002). In particular, this paper focuses on the maximum allowable provision under the standards of a platform to door gap of 40 mm horizontal length x 12 mm vertical step height. Beyond these dimensions, driver assistance is required.  A boarding simulation rig replicating the platform and train door threshold was constructed and mobility impaired users from the local community invited to participate in testing a range of gap variables. Data collected improved Melbourne’s rail operator Metro Trains Melbourne (MTM) and Victoria’s statutory authority Public Transport Victoria (PTV) understanding of a current design. Alongside the DSAPT legislation and the limitations in capability and confidence of mobility impaired passengers. Multiple simulations confirmed that the present platform design is a significant improvement in both accessibility and disability compliance but factors such as modern mobility scooters and wheelchair design and their operation still presented challenges.  This research has been undertaken in a design practice based PhD which seeks to address some of the operational obstacles revealed through the trials. Invited by the trial organisers, the author’s observations and response to the trials through design interventions are briefly discussed.}

Usually, these studies focus on the residential dimension, using official registries (e.g., census data), which show population distribution at night. Nevertheless, these studies disregard the fact that the population in cities is highly mobile, and its spatial distribution dramatically changes between night and day. The emergence of new data sources (Big Data) creates perfect conditions to consider segregation as a process, by providing the opportunity to dynamically analyse temporal changes in social segregation.This study uses mobile phone data to analyse changes in social segregation between night and day. Our case study is Medellin (Colombia), a highly socially-segregated, South American city, where social integration policies are being developed, targeting the population in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. We use several complementary indicators of social segregation, supplementing them with mobility indicators that help explain changes in spatial segregation between night and day.The main conclusion is that daily mobility reduces the concentration of a particular group within neighbourhoods and increases the degree of social mixing (exposure) in local settings. This greater social exposure softens local contrasts (outliers) and increases the extension of spatial clusters (positive spatial autocorrelation), so general clustering trends emerge more clearly. The study also makes clear that increased exposure during the day mainly occurs due to the mobility of the low-income population, who are the most likely to leave their neighbourhood during the day and who travel the greatest distances to the most diverse set of destinations.}

In many fast growing cities, such efforts have had the unintended consequence of fostering redevelopment of currently affordable rental housing in central locations, thus further limiting access to these locations for low-income households and contributing to new patterns of economic and racial segregation. Integrating equity concerns into sustainability planning has proven difficult. Advocates have relied on a variety of measures to assess the average vulnerability to displacement, transit access, and housing and transportation costs facing households of various types across neighborhoods. We propose a more locally grounded approach that estimates the potential loss of affordable rental units and values transit for the access to employment it provides low-income households in particular locations vulnerable to redevelopment, thus making tangible the overlap between social equity and environmental goals.Our three-part tool allows city planners to assess and compare conditions in transit corridors in order to prioritize and align investments in affordable housing preservation, transit improvements and mixed use redevelopment. It was designed to be replicable in other U.S. metropolitan areas by relying on an integrated national dataset, and linking it to a widely used scenario planning software plugin, Envision Tomorrow. We demonstrate the tool's utility and replicability for Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, two fast-growing cities at different stages in the development of their regional transit networks. Finally, we reflect on the utility of the tool for use in a variety of contexts including in cities outside of the U.S.}

Identification and modification of these characteristics may help to promote healthier cities.Objective: We estimated premature mortality impacts of breaching international exposure guidelines for physical activity (PA), air pollution, noise and access to green space for Bradford (UK) adult residents (n = 393,091).Methods: We applied the Urban and TranspOrt Planning Health Impact Assessment (UTOPHIA) methodology and estimated mortality, life expectancy (LE) and economic impacts of non-compliance with recommended exposure levels. We also investigated the distribution of the mortality burden among the population, focusing on socioeconomic position (SEP) as defined by deprivation status and ethnicity.Results: We estimated that annually almost 10\% of premature mortality (i.e. 375 deaths, 95\% CI: 276-474) in Bradford is attributable to non-compliance with recommended exposure levels. Non-compliance was also estimated to result in over 300 days of LE lost (95\% CI: 238-432), which translated in economic losses of over 50,000 per person (95\% CI: 38,518-69,991). 90\% of the premature mortality impact resulted from insufficient PA performance. Air and noise pollution and the lack of green space had smaller impacts (i.e. 48 deaths). Residents of lower SEP neighborhoods had the highest risks for adverse exposure and premature death. A larger number of deaths (i.e. 253 and 145, respectively) could be prevented by reducing air and noise pollution levels well below the guidelines.Discussion: Current urban and transport planning related exposures result in a considerable health burden that is unequally distributed among the Bradford population. Improvements in urban and transport planning practices including the reduction of motor traffic and the promotion of active transport together with greening of the district, particularly in areas of lower SEP, are promising strategies to increase PA performance and reduce harmful environmental exposures.}

  abstract = {The principles of public transport network planning include simplicity, legibility, frequency and spatial coverage. These principles are normally translated into a series of “Guidelines” setting out the specific standards for network design within a jurisdiction. In practice network planning principles guidelines usually concentrate on creating a bus network or on the role of buses within a multimodal network as rail-based routes are regarded as fixed in location and separate planning processes are typically used to design rail frequencies and stopping patterns. The outcome of the network planning gives rise to trade-offs between the economic and institutional environments and is conditioned by historical legacy. Bus routes often continue because historically this is the route that was traversed or because a bus replaced a previous tram route. This paper offers a case study based on Sydney, Australia where the network planning guidelines for Metropolitan Sydney still place emphasis on equality of spatial coverage despite moving towards a more ‘integrated’ approach to network planning. This paper identifies that guidelines focusing on equal spatial coverage may inadvertently promote inequity through not taking account of the difficulties (and therefore higher cost) of serving challenging topographical areas. This paper therefore examines the equity impacts of the implementation of service planning guidelines based on equal spatial coverage using Sydney as a case study. Criteria relating to equity will be established which are then measured using bus supply data, journey to work and socio-economic data. The conclusions of the paper are a contribution to network planning implementation with many cities both in Australia and elsewhere implementing similar guidelines to Sydney.}

  abstract = {Planning principles for public transport networks include simplicity, legibility, frequency, and spatial coverage. These principles are typically translated into a series of guidelines that set out the specific standards for network design within a jurisdiction. In practice, such guidelines usually concentrate on creating a has network or on defining the role of buses with in a multimodal network. as rail-based routes arc regarded as fixed in location, and separate planning processes are typically used to design rail frequency and stopping patterns. The outcome of network planning gives rise to tradeoffs between the economic and institutional environments and is conditioned by historical legacy. Bus routes often continue because they have operated at that location. This paper offers a case study of Sydney, Australia. where network planning guidelines still place emphasis on equality of spatial coverage despite moving toward a more integrated approach to network planning. The paper asserts that guidelines focusing on equal spatial coverage may inadvertently promote inequity by not taking account of the difficulties (and therefore higher cost) of serving challenging topographical areas. The paper examines the equity impacts of implementing service planning guidelines on the basis of equal spatial coverage. Criteria relating to equity are established and then measured with the use of data on bus supply. journeys to work, and socioeconomics. The conclusions of the paper contribute to implementation of network planning, with many cities in Australia and elsewhere implementing similar guidelines to those in Sydney.},

A stratified analysis by area-level disadvantage was conducted to detect optimal distances to supermarkets across socio-economic areas. Spatial distribution of supermarket and transport access was analysed using a geographic information system.Setting: Melbourne, Australia.Subjects: Adults (n 3128) from twelve local government areas (LGA) across Melbourne.Results: Supermarket access was protective of BMI for participants in high disadvantaged areas within 800m (P=0.040) and 1000m (P=0.032) road network buffers around the household but not for participants in less disadvantaged areas. In urban growth area LGA, only 26\% of dwellings were within 1 km of a supermarket, far less than 80-90\% of dwellings suggested in the local urban planning policy. Low public transport access compounded disadvantage.Conclusions: Rapid urbanisation is a global health challenge linked to increases in dietary risk factors and BMI. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying the most appropriate geographic scale to inform urban planning policy for optimal health outcomes across socio-economic strata. Urban planning policy implementation in disadvantaged areas within cities has potential for reducing health inequities.},

This work explores transportation benefits from the consumer's perspective to accessibility as a key benefit generated by any transportation project. To assess the full benefits of transportation project implementation for various consumers and calculate the improvement in accessibility, it is best to use Activity-Based Models (ABM). ABMs have two important advantages for equity analysis, which have not been utilized in the literature so far: first, ability to analyze results by various groups of the population; second, these models can utilize the Activity Based Accessibility (ABA) measure to estimate the overall benefits from transport investments and policies. The ABA measure allows one person to have different accessibilities for different choice situations, depending on his/her characteristics. We suggest including social and spatial factors in social welfare assessment by introducing the concept of accessibility gains to key social activities. Specifically, it is suggested to incorporate subjective well-being consideration into a new evaluation framework "Equity Benefit Analysis" (EBA). we use an alternative measure, "Subjective Value of Accessibility gains" (SVOA), which is based on the ABM accessibility measure as well as on Subjective Well Being (SWB) measure, as the key benefit taken into account in the evaluation process. The SVOA is not intended to replace the current practice of analyzing equity by comparing various impacts on different groups of the population, but can aid by providing policymakers with a single measure advancing both equity and efficiency considerations and facilitating comparison among alternatives. Initial case study results indicate the SVOA can show higher benefits to policies focusing on the needs of vulnerable social groups that compared traditional measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this work was to investigate and develop new approaches with specific emphasis on sub-Saharan Africa, given that the existing decision systems do not appropriately consider social impacts and poverty. An understanding of rural road funds allocation and road scheme prioritisation to alleviate poverty is important as road transport is by far the most predominant form of transport in Africa. This study developed new allocation and prioritisation processes for rural roads based on expert opinion surveys and empirical evidence, which were then applied to analyse allocation and road scheme selection processes used in Uganda and Ghana. The study found that the multi-dimensional poverty index is the most highly prioritised factor in rural road scheme selection and, for regional rural road funds sharing, poverty is equally weighted with the rural accessibility index. A goal programming model, based on expert opinion weightings, is recommended for poverty alleviation.}

This exploratory study applies a standardized analysis framework to health and wellbeing metrics of cities in the UK, Sweden, Estonia, Kenya and Thailand. This allows for comparison between geographically diverse cities to understand their role on citizens’ health. The authors assessed demographics, subjective stress and wellbeing, relationships between green and public spaces and features of the local environment on health in 659 adult participants across six study locations. The results indicate regional differences in stress and wellbeing and show correlations with living close to, and engaging with, green and/or public spaces. Issues regarding noise, air pollution and traffic congestion were reported as having an impact on personal wellbeing. The authors discuss the impact that diverse properties of green space may have had, as well as cross-cultural considerations between the impacts of the local environments. This exploratory research provides a base for future cross-cultural research using mixed-methods and multi-disciplinary approaches to explore socio-economic and infrastructure dimensions of urban spaces and their impact on health and wellbeing.}

The interest stems in part from the concern that inadequate spatial and temporal planning may foster social exclusion by giving rise to accessibility limitations that bear disproportionately on certain population groups. This paper proposes and implements person-based, time-specific indicators of accessibility. It will be shown how such indicators may help increase our understanding of how spatial patterns of accessibility of subgroups within the city evolve over time as a consequence of differences in space-time constraints. Unlike earlier studies of person-based accessibility, subgroup differences in accessibility will be measured during multiple time intervals over an entire week, using longitudinal activity-travel diaries and a time use survey. Our study shows that, within the city of Ghent (Belgium), male and female adults living with a different occupational status (i.e. full-time, part-time and unemployed) may experience significantly different levels of accessibility during the diurnal cycle as a consequence of variation in their time use patterns.}

However, modal accessibility disparity analysis adds value to the single-mode analysis by assessing the interaction between different transport modes and land use. A review of modal disparity studies shows that different accessibility metrics lead to different results, and so it is unclear how this impacts modal accessibility disparity variation. Moreover, the correspondence of the disparity spatial pattern between the different metrics is unclear. This research examines how three typical accessibility metrics (closest facility, cumulative opportunity, space-time constrained) impact modal disparity of grocery store accessibility in Warsaw, Poland. Further, local indicators of spatial association are used to identify areas of similarity and difference between the metrics. This study finds that cumulative opportunities during non-rush hours indicate the best car advantage for all travel times but indicate the best transit advantage during rush hours for 15 min. Generally, the space-time metric indicates better transit accessibility than the closest facility metric which in turn shows better transit accessibility than cumulative opportunities. The city center has significant spatial similarity while peripheral, especially dense, areas have significant spatial difference. Similarity areas have higher transit stop and population densities, while difference areas have average-to-low stop, population, road and store densities.}

Different accessibility measures for modelled future scenarios are analysed in the context of Santiago. The method builds from a simple accessibility formulation based on travel times forecasted by a four-step transport model. Using two subway projects as case study, methodological implications for assessment are then discussed. As a result, an index is proposed to incorporate equitable accessibility impacts parallel to CBA, which demands to further consolidate multi-criteria analysis.

A basic assumption of this paper is that out-home activities mediated through mobility can contribute to needs fulfillment, and, hence, wellbeing. This study explores the role of preferences, and individual and contextual constraints, in both the overall level of out-of-home activity participation in old age and the level of participation in three specific out-of-home activities (grocery shopping, visiting family or friends, and attending cultural activities). A person's degree of home orientation is used as an indicator of preference for indoor activities. The findings suggest that age, living status, income, education, holding a driving license, health, social network, centrality of residence, and the quality of the public transport supply have a significant impact on the overall participation level. In addition, the study suggests that the types of constraints vary between travel purposes and the location of activities. Moreover, there is an independent effect of the degree of home orientation on the overall participation level, on the degree of visits to family and friends and on the degree of attending cultural activities, which suggest that people differ in their need for out-of-home activities. However, degree of home orientation has no impact on the degree of grocery shopping, which might imply that grocery shopping is more independent of preferences. The main conclusion from this study is that the extent to which out-of-home activities fulfill needs vary between individuals, depending on their preferences as well as the interplay between individual abilities and resources and contextual conditions.}

It demonstrates that such transport-related factors as holding a driving license and subjective evaluations of public transport supply shape the level of unmet needs for out-of-home activity. Other factors that help explain differences in the extent of unmet activity needs include actual participation in out-of-home activities, self-perceived health and problems with walking, outlook on life, residential location and indicators of social support and social networks. It is concluded that policymakers seeking to raise wellbeing above a minimum threshold of what counts as a decent life should enhance older adults' ability to drive in old age and car availability, lower the distance to public transport stops, and improve the connectivity that public transport offers to destinations. Policies to improve wellbeing in later life should nonetheless move beyond silo thinking. Questions of mobility in later life require a cross-sector and holistic approach to policy that transcends the realm of transport planning.},

The road traffic crashes database of the General Directorate for Traffic was used. The dependent variable was the monthly number of people injured, stratified by sex, age, severity and type of road user. The explanatory variable (intervention) compared the post-intervention period (2004-6) with the pre-intervention period (2000-3).

In order to facilitate this, an Index of Mass Transport Provision (IMTP) was measured through proximity, frequency, and capacity. Then, an Index of Social Transport Needs (ISTN) was calculated by means of transport disadvantage indicators. Finally, the Index of Social Transport Needs Covered (ICSTN) was calculated. The calculations used geographic information systems and principal component analysis in 1834 geographic sections. Findings highlight that 50.3\% of the inhabitants have a very high level of social transport needs, while only 6.8\% of the population have very low social transport needs. Results show that SITEUR promotes advancement in public transport systems within the GMA relative to quality, security, and reliability and it also contributes to tackling social exclusion in the GMA.

Universal Design (UD) refers to the design of transport systems in a way that they are accessible to all users, irrespective of the users' abilities. This definition of UD has not yet gained roots in the transport economic literature. The conventional thinking is that UD is for the few (i.e., the impaired) and given that they are few in number, UD projects will generally be unprofitable from a socioeconomic point of view because benefits will be low while investment costs will be too high. The aim of this paper is to prove the opposite: UD projects benefit all users of the facility, whether impaired or not, and the additional costs of implementing them are generally low; hence, their net present values are high and positive. We build on collaborative work between the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the Institute of Transport Economics aimed at creating guidelines for assessing the economic merits of UD projects. Therefore, in this paper the authors: 1) define how UD is to be understood in the context of road and public transport; 2) describe the types of benefits and costs that accrue to users if UD projects are implemented; 3) address how the benefits and cost can be valued in monetary terms; and 4) using 3 different types of projects, demonstrate that UD projects are surprisingly profitable from a socioeconomic point of view. Lastly, the implications of the findings are addressed and why governments need to be concerned with UD of transport systems is explained.}

This study assessed whether travel time to health facilities was associated with childhood vaccine coverage in a remote area of Ethiopia.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using data from 775 children aged 12-59 months who participated in a household survey between January -July 2010 in Dabat district, north- western Ethiopia. 208 households were randomly selected from each kebele. All children in a household were eligible for inclusion if they were aged between 12-59 months at the time of data collection. Travel time to vaccine providers was collected using a geographical information system (GIS). The primary outcome was the percentage of children in the study population who were vaccinated with the third infant Pentavalent vaccine ([Diphtheria, Tetanus,-Pertussis Hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenza type b] Penta3) in the five years before the survey. We also assessed effects on BCG, Penta1, Penta2 and Measles vaccines. Analysis was conducted using Poisson regression models with robust standard error estimation and the Wald test.Results: Missing vaccination data ranged from 4.6\% (36/775) for BCG to 16.4\% (127/775) for Penta3 vaccine. In children with complete vaccination records, BCG vaccine had the highest coverage (97.3\% [719/739]), Penta3 coverage was (92.9\% [602/648]) and Measles vaccine had the lowest coverage (81.7\% [564/690]). Children living {$>$}= 60mins from a health post were significantly less likely (adjRR = 0.85 [0.79-0.92] p value {$<$} = 0.001) to receive Penta3 vaccine compared to children living {$<$}30mins from a health post. This effect was not modified by household wealth (p value = 0.240). Travel time also had a highly significant association with BCG (adjRR = 0.95 [0.93-0.98] p value = 0.002) and Measles (adjRR = 0.88 [0.79-0.97] p value =0.027) vaccine coverage.Conclusions: Travel time to vaccine providers in health posts appeared to be a barrier to the delivery of infant vaccines in this remote Ethiopian community. New vaccine delivery strategies are needed for the hardest to reach children in the African region.}

Apart from the impact of increased traffic volumes, the major factor attributed to this failure is that of policy disconnect between the process of diagnosing air pollution and its management, thereby limiting the capability of local authorities to control traffic-related sources of air pollution. Integrating air quality management into the Local Transport Plan (LIP) process therefore presents opportunities for enabling political will, funding and joined-up policy approach to reduce this limitation. However, despite the increased access to resources for air quality measures within the LIP process, there are local institutional, political and funding constraints which reduce the impact of these policy interventions on air quality management. This paper illustrate the policy implementation gaps between central government policy intentions and the local government process by providing evidence of the deprioritisation of air quality management compared to the other shared priorities in the LIP process. We draw conclusions on the policy and practice of integrating air quality management into transport planning. The evidence thereby indicate the need for a policy shift from a solely localised hotspot management approach, in which the LAQM framework operates, to a more holistic management of vehicular emissions within wider spatial administrative areas.

Knowledge of the burden of transport expenditure in the household budget seems essential for passenger transport policy formulation in order to improve their travel conditions and social equity.The literature review and the three case studies (Dar es Salaam, Niamey, Ouagadougou) show that estimates of travel expenditure are partially conditioned by survey data collection methodologies and by the choice of equivalence scales used to compare the standard of living of households. According to consumption and expenditure survey data, the relative amount spent on transport increases as household expenditure rises. Conversely, the share of transport decreases as income rises when analysing travel survey data. The sensitivity to the equivalence scale is tested for several transport expenditure indicators: the share of travel expenditure by household budget quintile, the concentration indices for public and private household transport expenditure and the average monthly expenditure per person on public and private transport. Results also highlight the fact that transport is a major component of household expenditure, that there are considerable inequalities between households and that regular use of motorized transport is unaffordable for poor populations. These findings have implications for both improving expenditure data collection methodologies in the transport area and formulating pro-poor urban policies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we assess street-level accessibility in the city of Cuenca (Ecuador) to examine the disparities for people with different mobility conditions.Methods: We designed and implemented a mobile-based tool to audit street-level accessibility related to two key issues: the compliance level with the national standard for accessibility (NAMF) and the presence and characteristics of obstacles that hinder pedestrian mobility. A set of 214 street segments were audited by volunteers with different mobility conditions (unrestricted, restricted, or impaired). The collected data were analysed to compute accessibility indices (AIs) for each condition ranging from 0 (totally inaccessible) to 1 (totally accessible). AI values were examined to determine the differences among conditions.Results: None of the 214 audited street segments fully complied with the NAMF. The AIs were: unrestricted mobility = 0.4, restricted mobility = 0.29, impaired mobility = 0.12. Eighty-three percent of the audited streets were perceived as highly inaccessible by wheelchair users, whereas for individuals with restricted or unrestricted mobility, the rates were 50\% and 34\%, respectively. Most streets were affected by obstacles that hindered mobility, with curb ramps and driveway ramps having the highest impact on accessibility.Conclusion: The urban streets of Cuenca are highly inaccessible, mainly due to their flawed design and the presence of obstacles, creating excluding environments for people with mobility restrictions or impairments. National regulations are failing to tackle all the issues that hinder accessibility and must be revised. Cuenca, together with other intermediate cities in Latin America, must redesign their sidewalks and pedestrian facilities to allow universal accessibility.}

  abstract = {The study investigated the relationship between distribution of intercity road passenger terminals and  transport needs of all socio-economic groups in the city. An understanding of this relationship is vital to the terminal location policies and programmes that provides for equity, access and economic benefit. The primacy of the city, its economic status and the high level of regional interaction placed high demand on its transport system, particularly the terminals. This has implication on terminal distribution, patronage and economic activities. The specific objectives examined include the factors influencing the spatial distribution of passenger terminals and their impact on people’s transport demand and public and private sector response to terminal provisions. The paper adopted a cross sectional survey approach using structured questionnaires administered on the terminal operators in each of the one hundred and fifty nine (159) terminals which are distributed across three activity zones namely CBD, Transition and Residential. Information collected includes terminal characteristics and other factors influencing choice of location. The nearest neighbour analysis was used to determine the pattern of terminal location while analysis of variance technique was used to test the variation in termina distribution across three activity zones. Data were also collected on the socio economic characteristics of passengers. One thousand three hundred and fifty eight (1358) passengers were randomly selected and interviewed to determine their level of patronage of the terminals and how accessible are the terminals to their residential locations within the city. Findings from the study revealed that terminal distribution is clustered and their operational characteristics vary significantly  across the three different activity zones. The knowledge of operational problems, locational advantage of petrol retail outlet and government intervention significantly influences the choice of terminal  location. The clustered locational pattern of the terminals is at variance to some existing theories of equidistance spatial distribution of such higher order services implying several passengers had to travel longer distance and time that is inconsistent with objectives of national transport policy. The study concluded that an understanding of the pattern and factors that influence terminal location and patronage is crucial to the transport needs of socio-economic groups in the city. The overall transport policy implications to the city development in the country are discussed.}

Currently, however, relatively little is known about the extent to which Canadians with disabilities are able to exercise of this right. Previous research has investigated the employment status and commute distance of persons with disabilities in Canada. In this paper, we use the 2006 Participation and Activity Limitation Survey to investigate, from the perspective of Canadian adults with disabilities, the factors that influence (1) their frequency of participation in various leisure and recreation activities; (2) the role of transportation in activity participation; and (3) the desire for more leisure and recreation activities during spare time. The latter question is closely associated to the experience of exclusion. The results of the analysis indicate that some of the very factors that tend to reduce participation also relate to a desire for more leisure and recreation activities.},

  abstract = {Background: Geographical access to health care facilities is known to influence health services usage. As societies age, accessibility to health care becomes an increasingly acute public health concern. It is known that seniors tend to have lower mobility levels, and it is possible that this may negatively affect their ability to reach facilities and services. Therefore, it becomes important to examine the mobility situation of seniors vis-a-vis the spatial distribution of health care facilities, to identify areas where accessibility is low and interventions may be required.Methods: Accessibility is implemented using a cumulative opportunities measure. Instead of assuming a fixed bandwidth (i.e. a distance threshold) for measuring accessibility, in this paper the bandwidth is defined using model-based estimates of average trip length. Average trip length is an all-purpose indicator of individual mobility and geographical reach. Adoption of a spatial modelling approach allows us to tailor these estimates of travel behaviour to specific locations and person profiles. Replacing a fixed bandwidth with these estimates permits us to calculate customized location-and person-based accessibility measures that allow inter-personal as well as geographical comparisons.Data: The case study is Montreal Island. Geo-coded travel behaviour data, specifically average trip length, and relevant traveller's attributes are obtained from the Montreal Household Travel Survey. These data are complemented with information from the Census. Health care facilities, also geo-coded, are extracted from a comprehensive business point database. Health care facilities are selected based on Standard Industrial Classification codes 8011-21 (Medical Doctors and Dentists).Results: Model-based estimates of average trip length show that travel behaviour varies widely across space. With the exception of seniors in the downtown area, older residents of Montreal Island tend to be significantly less mobile than people of other age cohorts. The combination of average trip length estimates with the spatial distribution of health care facilities indicates that despite being more mobile, suburban residents tend to have lower levels of accessibility compared to central city residents. The effect is more marked for seniors. Furthermore, the results indicate that accessibility calculated using a fixed bandwidth would produce patterns of exposure to health care facilities that would be difficult to achieve for suburban seniors given actual mobility patterns.Conclusions: The analysis shows large disparities in accessibility between seniors and non-seniors, between urban and suburban seniors, and between vehicle owning and non-owning seniors. This research was concerned with potential accessibility levels. Follow up research could consider the results reported here to select case studies of actual access and usage of health care facilities, and related health outcomes.},

A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels.},

  abstract = {Accessibility is a widely used concept in transportation planning and research. However a majority of the literature is concerned with accessibility in infrastructure-rich regions where it is used to assess the output of infrastructure. Relatively scant attention in contrast has been paid to the topic of accessibility in infrastructure-poor regions. These are regions characterized by non-homogeneous landscapes with limited or no transportation infrastructure. Even studies that deal with infrastructure-poor regions tend to transpose the methods used elsewhere. This practice seems inappropriate when mobility happens by active rather than motorized modes since the effort required for movement is likely different. The objective of this paper is to compare distance, time, and metabolic energy cost functions in walking accessibility. To this end, we present a case study of accessibility to water in central Kenya. The results indicate that Euclidean distance, surface distance, and travel time correlate better between them than any of them does with metabolic energy. Furthermore, while shortest paths tend to be symmetric for distance and time criteria, under consideration of metabolic energy expenditure pathways change significantly depending on the direction of movement. This has implications for measuring accessibility and equity. By providing alternate mechanisms for valuing the cost of movement, this research suggests avenues to consider vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women who require greater nutritional intake and expend more energy per unit activity. Directions for further research include certain trade-offs between route choice variables across various applications, for example, walking and cycling route choice algorithms.}

   abstract = {This study investigates how socio-demographic and attitudinal variables of university students affect their desire to increase or decrease their daily commute. The case study is McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, and data was obtained by means of a web-based survey that included questions regarding travel behavior, socio-demographic information, and attitudes toward travel, land use, and the environment. The objective variable is defined as the ratio of ideal to actual commute time, and regression analysis is implemented to test the relationship between this variable and socio-demographic variables and attitudinal scores. The impact of different attitudes on the gap between ideal and actual commute time is expanded to include three different modes, active travel (walk/cycle), transit, and personal automobile. Interestingly, the results indicate that active travelers tend to be less dissatisfied with their commute, followed by those who travel in a personal vehicle and transit users. A number of attitudinal responses are shown to impact the desire to travel more or less, including variables that relate to the social environment, availability of local activities, quality of facilities, productive use of the commute, and the intrinsic value found in the commute travel. The picture emerges of a traveler who would like to spend more time commuting, as someone who is an active traveler, thinks that getting there is half the fun, dislikes traveling alone, but rather likes to live in an active neighborhood where there is a sense of community. The results suggests that enjoyment of commuting, while a challenge from the perspective of motorized mobility, may provide valuable policy opportunities from the perspective of active transportation.

However, this has been understudied in the literature. This paper aims to estimate the equity of TT and RT services during peak hours and to study how the entry of RT affects equity by analyzing trip data of TT and RT in New York City in 2010 and 2017 (before and after the entry of RT). First, we used the Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient to estimate the equity of taxi services against population and employment. The results show that the equity of RT in 2017 is higher than that of TT and the equity of TT + RT in 2017 is higher than that of 2010. Mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) was applied to determine whether the relationships between taxi trips and population/employment would vary across different taxi zones. The coefficient of variation (CV) of local coefficients of population/employment is used as an indicator of equity. Results show that RT services were more equitable than TT services in 2017 and that the overall taxi service in 2017 was more equitable than that of 2010.}

There is a wealth of knowledge on the issues that exist in the environment but budgetary constraints mean not every issue can be addressed. As such, many barriers to transport access still exist in the urban environment and public transport systems, which often leads to social exclusion; despite advancements that have been made to better cater for the needs of disabled people. This paper attempts to identify and prioritize the key issues that require addressing from the perspective of visually impaired public transport users that would bring the greatest mobility benefits in their journeys from origin to destination. A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted to identify these key issues. A total of 17 visually impaired participants were involved in this study, including 6 with total blindness and 11 with partial vision, in varying degrees. The main barriers were due to bus driver’s unawareness of disabled people’s needs, obstructions on footpaths, poor information, poor bus infrastructure, poor bus services, and barriers from construction. The consequences of being unable to travel independently caused many of the participants to feel frustrated, isolated, stressed, and resentment. The results revealed that improving bus driver training, more strategically placed pedestrian crossings, and more availability of real-time information would bring the greatest mobility benefits.}

Thus, promoting equal access to large parks is increasingly becoming a goal of environmental justice activists, planners, and policymakers. Disadvantaged populations (e.g., low-income people of color) have worse walking access to large parks than more privileged groups and might rely on public transportation to access such parks. But empirical studies on whether access to large parks via public transit is justly distributed are lacking. In this paper, we examine the relationship between a novel measure of public transit access to large parks (the T2P index) and neighborhood-level disadvantage (income, race/ethnicity, and age). Using network analysis with public transit feed data and park location data, we calculate the T2P index for every census block group in the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the U.S. West. We find some evidence of environmental injustice. A spatial filtering model shows that T2P access increases when a neighborhood has a larger share of non-Hispanic Whites and a smaller share of older adults, but that median household income is not associated with T2P in the entire sample. We also find that some regions present significant environmental injustices in T2P whereas others have fewer to no injustices. Transit agencies and park planners could use our T2P index and findings to prioritize transit investment for disadvantaged populations and promote healthy living.}

In this article, we ask whether the social vulnerability of Amazonian cities to floods and droughts is linked to differences in their spatial accessibility. To assess the accessibility of 310 urban centers, we developed a travel network and derived measures of connectivity and geographical remoteness. We found that 914,654 people live in roadless urban centers (n = 68) located up to 2,820km from their state capital. We then tested whether accessibility measures explained interurban differences in quantitative measures of social sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and an overlooked risk area, food system sensitivity. Accessibility explained marked variation in indicators of each of these dimensions and, hence, for the first time, we show an underlying spatial basis for social vulnerability. For instance, floods pose a greater disease risk in less accessible urban centers because inadequate sanitation in these places exposes inhabitants to environmental pollution and contaminated water, exacerbated by poverty and governance failures. Exploring the root causes of these spatial inequalities, we show how remote and roadless cities in Amazonia have been historically marginalized and their citizens exposed to structural violence and economic disadvantage. Paradoxically, we found that places with the highest social vulnerability have the greatest natural and cultural assets (rainforest, indigenous peoples, and protected areas). We conclude that increasing accessibility through road building would be maladaptive, exposing marginalized people to further harm and exacerbating climatic change by driving deforestation.}

Current American and European guidelines suggest performing catheterization within 90 minutes of the first medical contact. For this reason, this study evaluates the populated places that are within a 90 minute transfer time to a city with a catheterization facility. The three modes of transport considered in this study are ground ambulance, rotary wing air ambulance and fixed wing air ambulance.Methods: Reference data from the Alberta Chart of Call were interpolated into continuous travel time surfaces. These continuous surfaces allowed for the delineation of isochrones: lines that connect areas of equal time. Using Dissemination Area (DA) centroids to represent the adult population, the population numbers were extracted from the isochrones using Statistics Canada census data.Results: By extracting the adult population from within isochrones for each emergency transport mode analyzed, it was found that roughly 70\% of the adult population of Alberta had access within 90 minutes to catheterization facilities by ground, roughly 66\% of the adult population had access by rotary wing air ambulance and that no population had access within 90 minutes using the fixed wing air ambulance. An overall understanding of the nature of air vs. ground emergency travel was also uncovered; zones were revealed where the use of one mode would be faster than the others for reaching a facility.Conclusion: Catheter intervention for acute myocardial infarction is a time sensitive procedure. This study revealed that although a relatively small area of the province had access within the 90 minute time constraint, this area represented a large proportion of the population. Within Alberta, fixed wing air ambulance is not an effective means of transporting patients to a catheterization facility within the 90 minute time frame, though it becomes advantageous as a means of transportation for larger distances when there is less urgency.}

Our empirical strategy relies on long-term changes in poverty and access to bus transit at the neighborhood level in the Atlanta metropolitan area. We estimate the effect of bus transit access on poverty using fixed effects models to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics. Furthermore, we undertake several robustness checks using a combination of instrumental variable regression, subsample analysis, and propensity score matching. Our results indicate that, on average, after controlling for neighborhood characteristics, census tracts with better access to public bus transportation have a higher proportion of low-income households - in both the central city and the suburbs. Thus, policies that improve access to transit in underserved areas can plausibly expand residential opportunities for the poor and reduce spatial inequities in urban centers.}

Improvement of cycling behavior has been paid much attention in the developed countries, but it has received less attention in the developing nations. Shiraz in Iran, currently has a partial cycling network which has been unsuccessful and is rarely used for cycling. This research explored and classified the features and their inclusive factors in relation to cycling behavior and examined their impact on its improvement.Methods: Delphi study was applied to revise and finalize the features and factors related to cycling behavior. Then, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to give a weighting to these features and their related factors. Results: Not surprisingly, Physical Infrastructure of Cycling Network proved to be the most important feature in regards to cycling behavior (22.3\% of the total criteria). This feature was followed by Traffic Safety along the Cycling Network (13.1\%), Density, Land uses and Accessibility (12.1\%) and Personal Security along the Cycling Network (10.2\%). In addition, "appropriate depth of view along the cycling network" emerged as the most important factor (subcriteria) in relation to cycling behavior (5.4\% of the total sub-criteria).Conclusions: Present research supports the findings of previous studies regarding the contribution of the majority of the identified features and their related factors towards the improvement of cycling behavior. Beside, findings of this research as its novelties are:1) Certain factors implying on how to expand the current cycling network; 2) Emerging visibility and depth of view as the important factor for improvement of cycling behavior; 3) Relative certain cultural factors. The features and factors recognized in this research could be applied by associated authorities to expand the current cycling network as well as improve cycling behavior in this context.}

Neighborhoods within 30, 60, or 90 minutes travel were identified. Travel time by air ambulance was calculated and adjusted for flying speed and some delays.RESULTS: Approximately 8\% and 15\% of the study population did not have timely geographic accessibility to emergency stroke and MI care, respectively. Populations with poor access were located in rural areas. The entire study population had timely access by air ambulance.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified disparities in geographic accessibility to emergency stroke and MI care in East Tennessee. Use of air ambulance or telemedicine could play a vital role in addressing these disparities. This information is important for evidence-based health planning and resource allocation.

Nonetheless, there is still little engagement with theories in political philosophy to frame what justice means in the context of transport policies. This paper reviews key theories of justice (utilitarianism, libertarianism, intuitionism, Rawls’ egalitarianism, and Capability Approaches ({CAs})) and critically evaluates the insights they generate when applied to transport. Based on a combination of Rawlsian and {CAs}, we propose that distributive justice concerns over transport disadvantage and social exclusion should focus primarily on accessibility as a human capability. This means that, in policy evaluation, a detailed analysis of the distributional effects of transport policies should take account of the setting of minimum standards of accessibility to key destinations and the extent to which these policies respect individuals’ rights and prioritise disadvantaged groups, reduce inequalities of opportunities, and mitigate transport externalities. A full account of justice in transportation requires a more complete understanding of accessibility than traditional approaches have been able to deliver to date.},

  abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has raised concerns about the responsiveness of cities and healthcare systems during pandemics. Recent studies try to model how the number of COVID-19 infections will likely grow and impact the demand for hospitalization services at national and regional levels. However, less attention has been paid to the geographic access to COVID-19 healthcare services and to hospitals? response capacity at the local level, particularly in urban areas in the Global South. This paper shows how transport accessibility analysis can provide actionable information to help improve healthcare coverage and responsiveness. It analyzes accessibility to COVID-19 healthcare at high spatial resolution in the 20 largest cities of Brazil. Using network-distance metrics, we estimate the vulnerable population living in areas with poor access to healthcare facilities that could either screen or hospitalize COVID-19 patients. We then use a new balanced floating catchment area (BFCA) indicator to estimate spatial, income, and racial inequalities in access to hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators while taking into account congestion effects. Based on this analysis, we identify substantial social and spatial inequalities in access to health services during the pandemic. The availability of ICU equipment varies considerably between cities, and it is substantially lower among black and poor communities. The study maps territorial inequalities in healthcare access and reflects on different policy lessons that can be learned for other countries based on the Brazilian case.}

Most accessibility problems in cities occur in consolidated areas that were developed prior to the development of current accessibility regulations. This leads to consider the importance of focusing more effort on managing the improvement of the accessibility of existing public urban environments. As such, the objective of this research is to design a conceptual model for accessibility management in consolidated urban environments. Unlike other research focusing on city users to collect information on accessibility problems or to provide services to improve wayfinding, this method has a focus on urban accessibility managers. The model is based on the assessment of the level of accessibility of urban environments together with the assessment of management processes in which city users are actively involved. It consists of a set of basic indicators for the identification of accessible pedestrian routes, and provides a dynamic accessibility index for the evaluation of their efficient management by the responsible governments. The inclusion of this assessment framework in the management process itself enables the necessary improvement actions to be identified and taken in time. ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) provide the communication channel between the responsible governments and city users, making this a more dynamic and efficient management model based on assessment possible.}

  abstract = {Initiatives for global economic integration increasingly prioritize new infrastructure in relatively remote regions. Such regions have relatively intact ecosystems and provide valuable ecosystem services, which has stimulated debates over the wisdom of new infrastructure. Most prior research on infrastructure impacts highlights economic benefits, ecological damage, or social conflicts. We suggest a more integrative approach to regional integration by appropriating the concepts of connectivity from transport geography and social-ecological resilience from systems ecology. Connectivity offers a means of observing the degree of integration between locations, and social-ecological resilience provides a framework to simultaneously consider multiple consequences of regional integration. Together, they offer a spatial analysis of resilience that considers multiple dimensions of infrastructure impacts. Our study case is the southwestern Amazon, a highly biodiverse region which is experiencing integration via paving of the Inter-Oceanic Highway. Specifically, we focus on the "MAP" region, a tri-national frontier where Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru meet and which differs in the extent of highway paving. We draw on a tri-national survey of more than 100 resource-dependent rural communities across the MAP frontier and employ indicators for multiple dimensions of connectivity and social-ecological resilience. We pursue a comparative analysis among regions and subregions with differing degrees of community connectivity to markets in order to evaluate their social-ecological resilience. The findings indicate that connectivity and resilience have a multifaceted relationship, such that greater community connectivity corresponds to greater resilience in some respects but not others. We conclude by noting how our findings integrate those from heretofore largely disparate literatures on infrastructure. The integration of transport geography with resilience thought thus stands to advance the study of infrastructure impacts.},

Reduced mobility includes not only disabled people but also older people and  those with heavy shopping, bulky luggage and people with buggies. It is widely  acknowledged that the aging demographic profile of the population will have a  significant impact on the demand for accessible transport vehicles and infrastructure. Section 40 of the United Kingdom (UK) Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) of 1995 gives the Secretary of State a power to make regulations to ensure that public service vehicles are  accessible to disabled people. The government used this power to introduce the  Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000. The Regulations state that  from December 31, 2,000 new single and double deck buses that can carry more than  22 passengers need to be accessible to disabled people, including wheelchair users. The number of bus and light rail passenger journeys in England was nearly 4.9 billion  in 2008/9. The new generation of low floor buses has improved access not only for  wheelchair users but also people with other mobility difficulties, people with small  children in buggies, and those carrying heavy shopping or luggage. The demands for  the accessible space on low floor buses can exceed supply on certain routes and/or  at times when the buses are especially busy.}

Several public transportation modes are available in Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) such as buses, heavy rails, vans, boats, taxis, and trains while in some areas have fewer modes of public transport available. The disparity of public transport service negatively impacts social equity. This study aims to identify the gaps between public transport supply and demand and to demonstrate introduced indicators to assess the public transport performance incorporating transport capacity and equilibrium access aspects. Supply index was used to evaluate the level of service, and the demand index was applied to estimate travel needs. Furthermore, the Lorenz curves and the Gini coefficients were used to measure the equity of public transport. The results highlight that more than half of the BMR population is living in low-supply high-demand areas for public transportation. Moreover, the equitable access analysis has identified that the high-income population has better access to public transport than the low-income population. The results suggest that public transport gaps and equity indicate the inclusiveness of public transportation, as well as to the areas where to improve the public transport service. Thus, the methodology used in this study can be applied to another city or region similar to BMR.},

Travel training, which makes use of one-on-one instruction, may help people with IDD overcome transportation barriers. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a comprehensive travel training program on the travel skills of individuals with IDD.Methods: Participants were a convenience sample of all individuals with IDD (n = 87) who received travel training from the Kennedy Center in 2016 and 2017. Pre- and post-test scores on the Progressive Evaluation of Travel Skills, as well as primary mode(s) of public transportation used, purpose of use, and number of training sessions were recorded in a secure database. Data was de-identified which involved a process of removing any personally identifiable information. A secondary analysis was completed to test the effect of travel training on transportation skill acquisition by using multilevel analyses. Specifically, the effects of condition (Intellectual Disability (ID) without ASD, ID and ASD, ASD without ID), time (pre-training, post-training), and condition x time interactions on transportation skill T-scores were analyzed.Results: Participants were 69 men and 18 women with IDD and/or ASD (mean age = 23.6). Trainees made statistically significant gains on the competencies needed for independent travel. A significant condition x time (training) interaction was observed. Prior to training, people with ID (with and without ASD) had less developed travel skills than those with ASD (and no ID). Upon completion of the training, those with ID made larger gains in travel skills than those with ASD/no ID in which both groups had comparable skill levels.Conclusions: The results of this study provide preliminary support for the use of a structured and comprehensive travel training program to improve overall travel skills needed for public transportation.}

The second addresses the practical integration of gender equality into the transportation sector.  Results are presented from a study that focuses on differences between women's and men's experiences with road infrastructure; on preferences regarding different parts of the road system; and on the priority rankings of the different goals in the transportation sector such as accessibility, effectiveness, safety, regional development, and a good environment.  Interviews were held with 47 experts, users, professional driving instructors, and inspectors.  In general, women have a more cooperative approach to road system infrastructure and the problems therein, and men are more individualistic.  However, there are also noteworthy differences among age, socioeconomic group, and residential location.  This study is a first step toward gathering knowledge that can be used on a practical level to attain a more gender-equal transportation system in Sweden.},

To develop a sustainable society, a more equalitarian and safe transport system for both users and transport sector employees is needed. This work prioritizes the needs and barriers previously identified as relevant among transport system users and employees for four different transport scenarios (railways, autonomous vehicles (AVs), bicycle-sharing services (BSSs), and employment). The aim of this paper is to prioritize the factors affecting women in these four transport scenarios with the help of a survey followed by the application of mathematical and computational algorithms based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methodology. The identification of factors with higher influence in the fair participation of women in the transport sector will help transport planners, bike-sharing system owners, decision-makers, transport companies, and regulatory professionals to develop measures that could plausibly increase the proportion of women as users of BSSs, users of rail public transport, and AVs, as well as employees in the transport sector for a sustainable society. The results indicated that safety and security were the most challenging factors for railways. Weather, topography, and family responsibilities were shown to have a high influence on the use of BSSs. In the case of autonomous vehicles, the simultaneity and trust in the technology are the main opportunities to influence the acceptance of such vehicles. Finally, for transport employment, caring and parenting responsibilities were the factors that had the largest effect. Some differences in priorities were found for different profiles of women.},

  abstract = {Metro systems act as fast and efficient transport systems for many modern metropolises; however, enhancing higher usage of such systems often conflicts with providing suitable accessibility options. The traditional approach of metro accessibility studies seems to be an ineffective measure to gage sustainable access in which the equal rights of all users are taken into account. Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) transportation has increasingly relied on the role of two mass rapid transport systems publicly called "BTS Skytrain" and "MRT Subway", due to limited availability of land and massive road congestion; however, access to such transit arguably treats some vulnerable groups, especially women, the elderly and disabled people unfairly. This study constructs a multi-dimensional assessment of accessibility considerations to scrutinize how user groups access metro services based on BMR empirical case. 600 individual passengers at various stations were asked to rate the questionnaire that simultaneously considers accessibility aspects of spatial, feeder connectivity, temporal, comfort/safety, psychosocial and other dimensions. It was interestingly found by user disaggregated accessibility model that the lower the accessibility perceptions-related uncomfortable and unsafe environment conditions, the greater the equitable access to services, as illustrated by MRT-Hua Lumphong and MRT-Petchaburi stations. The study suggests that, to balance the access priorities of groups on services, policy actions should emphasize acceptably safe access for individuals, cost efficient feeder services connecting the metro lines, socioeconomic influences and time allocation. Insightful discussions on integrated approach balancing different dimensions of accessibility and recommendations would contribute to accessibility-based knowledge and potential propensity to use the public transits towards transport sustainability.}

In particular, the promotion by the UK Department for Transport of accessibility planning is examined. Although this initiative is not totally without merit, the resulting analysis may be too aggregate, both spatially and socially. The weakness of such an approach is that transport-related social exclusion is not always a socially and spatially concentrated process. Instead we suggest a matrix of area accessibility, area mobility and individual mobility as a possible schema for identifying concentrated and scattered manifestations of social exclusion and inclusion and for suggesting appropriate policy responses. This schema helps produce a more spatially and socially differentiated conceptualisation of social exclusion, helps identify policy responses and most critically highlights that the problems of the socially excluded immobile should not be analysed in isolation from the socially included mobile.

Using the School Travel Survey, we examined South Carolina school district leaders' perceptions of factors that influence elementary and middle school students walking to school.METHODS: Frequency distributions and chi-square tests were used to analyze the survey responses; open-ended questions were reviewed qualitatively for recurring topics and themes.RESULTS: School and district leaders (N = 314) most often reported street crossing safety (54.0\%) and number of sidewalks (54.0\%) as priority factors that should be addressed to increase students' active travel to school, followed by distance to school (46.0\%), traffic volume (42.4\%), parental attitudes (27.0\%), traffic speed (26.7\%), neighborhood condition (24.4\%), and student attitudes (10.0\%). Several respondents expressed concerns about liability issues related to students' active travel to school while others reported that schools are not responsible for students' safety once students leave school grounds. Independent of their comments about liability, respondents were concerned about the safety of students while walking to school.CONCLUSIONS: Those promoting active travel to school may benefit from addressing those factors perceived as most important by school and district leaders, including street crossing safety, number of sidewalks, and by educating school and district leaders about liability and safety issues related to students walking to school.}

An application of the index to transport is also presented, using 49 of the largest US metropolitan regions as case studies. Job accessibility by public transport is assessed for two population subgroups especially likely to benefit from public transport: adults without a car and adults living in poverty. It is found that the car-less population is comparatively better served by public transport than the poor population. Additionally, regions with a higher TPI score for car-less populations also tend to have public transport systems that better serve their population living in poverty. These results highlight that the proposed index allows for easy comparison across regions, despite large differences in the scale of the variable of interest (accessibility by public transport), the total population, and the size of the target groups (car-less or adults in poverty).},

  abstract = {Justice has long been central to geographic research but attention to the concept itself has been less explicitly theorized within the discipline. This article specifically traces the ways in which justice has been theorized within human geography. The review identifies commonalities among justice applications within geography, suggesting a shift beyond distributive and ideal theories of justice toward those explicating injustices coming more from bottom-up approaches. At the same time, it identifies the tendency of geographers to approach the concept of justice through normative-political approaches rather than normative-analytical justifications of socio-spatial phenomena. The paper illustrates the value of both approaches to justice theorizing but cautions that geographers should continue to justify the use of the concept within their work to avoid attenuating it. In ending, the paper illustrates how justice-oriented geographers can continue to identify why justice is central to their scholarship.},

  abstract = {Accessibility, as a requisite to guarantee the individual ability to participate in valued activities, has been receiving increasing yet scattered attention from diverse theoretical and operational approaches. These approaches focus on how individuals are able to engage in out-of-home activities, participate in social life as well as on their involvement in other activities that contribute to their overall well-being. The paper aims at further investigating such approaches, analysing forms of inequality in job-related mobilities while assuming that a person's accessibility depends on both contextual and individual factors. Taking the Buenos Aires metropolitan area as a suitable testbed, the paper offers an approach to identify the inequalities in job-related accessibility at the neighbourhood scale. The approach considers the relationship between the quality and supply of public transport, level of social exclusion and reachable employment opportunities. The research proposes a synthetic index of inequalities in access to job opportunities (IAO) to identify disadvantaged urban areas characterized by a confluence of problems related to socio-economic deprivations, low accessibility to employment as well as a low mobility and poor quality of transport supply. The approach has an explicit operational dimension and intends to contribute to outlining tailored measures to guarantee better job opportunities, as in the case of people living in areas experiencing sub-standard levels of accessibility to workplaces.}

The ease with which the end-user can reach a TSF (e.g., bus stops, rail stations, or multimodal centers) plays prominently in the decision making process of the individual. This paper presents a working definition for transit market potential based on accessibility in terms of walking distance and walking time.  Further, a measure is constructed to evaluate transit market potential for TSF locations for a transit system. The measure of transit potential is represented by an index value based on demographic criteria such as employment, household size, vehicle ownership, etc.  This index can be used to identify locations of TSFs that increase a route's potential for ridership.  A methodology is proposed to estimate the Index of Transit Potential (ITP) for TSFs.  This methodology involves identifying the accessible network of streets around each TSF that is within an acceptable access threshold for a transit rider, and estimating the transit market potential based on key demographic characteristics.  The analytical and visualization capabilities of a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) program are utilizes to help attain the objective.  A case study is used to demonstrate the application of the methodology.}

The methodology involves: (1) identifying census blocks groups with older, non-institutionalized populations that may be “at high-risk” or “at moderate risk” of a decreased ability to reside in a non-institutionalized community-based setting, (2) geocoding locations of community-based resources (e.g.) health and social services, law enforcement and emergency services, and local government offices) that are the key to the well being of older residents, (3) conducting a transportation network analysis, and (4) identifying the best travel path for older residents to access various needed community-based resources.  “At high-risk” and “at moderate-risk” census blocks groups are identified as a function of three demographic characteristics: (1) with income below the poverty threshold, (2) with one or more disabilities, and, given these two factors, and (3) living alone.  Network analysis tools in standard geographic information system (GIS) software are used to identify the best travel path to access community resources from “at high-risk” and “at moderate-risk” census block groups.  The identified “best travel path” is based on travel distance, travel time, traffic volumes, number of intersections along the path, and the number of crashes involving older residents.  The methodology is illustrated using data from a project that used GIS methods to indicate the physical relationship of older sub-populations to needed community resources in a section of the Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area.}

This study focuses on roundabouts without bicycle facilities (i.e., mixed traffic conditions) and makes use of semi-automated video observation software with the aim of analysing bicyclists' behaviour and safety on roundabouts with different diameter. Four urban roundabouts in Belgium are observed. Interactions between bicyclists and other vehicles are analysed using speed, lateral position and five indicators to describe the closeness of interactions (TTCmin, PET, T-2 (min), lateral overtaking proximity and minimum distance headway). Additionally, the lateral position and riding speed of bicyclists that are in interaction with other vehicles is compared with the behaviour of bicyclists that are not in interaction with other vehicles.The behavioural analysis revealed that regardless of the type of condition (free-flow bicyclists or different interactions bicyclist-car), bicyclists always ride faster on roundabouts with big diameter and slower on roundabouts with small diameter. Moreover, bicyclists ride closer to the central island on roundabouts with big diameter compared to roundabouts with small diameter for all the conditions analysed.The analysis of surrogate safety indicators (TTCmin, PET, T-2 min) revealed that close inter- actions between bicyclists and cars are relatively frequent at both small and big roundabouts. The percentages of close interactions are more or less equal for roundabouts with big diameter (7.86\% of observed interactions) and roundabouts with small diameter (8.24\%). The analysis of the indicators to describe the closeness of interactions also showed that the closest interactions at roundabouts are all situations where the bicyclist has a leading role. The analysis of the most common types of close interactions revealed indeed that the most common close interactions are interactions where the bicyclist is entering the roundabout. The analysis of lateral overtaking proximity showed that bicyclists who overtake a car take smaller lateral overtaking proximities compared to cars overtaking a bicyclist. The analysis of minimum distance headway finally revealed that bicyclists who ride behind a car take smaller distance headways compared to cars driving behind a bicyclist.

  abstract = {One-way restrictions on local streets, which tend to have low traffic stress, can create a significant barrier to low-stress cycling. Contraflow, a treatment that undoes one-way restrictions on bike travel, has the potential to improve low-stress connectivity. Although contraflow is applied routinely in the Netherlands and Belgium, it has been sparingly applied in the United States. We propose refined measures of connectivity and accessibility that account for one-way restrictions by requiring a low-stress round trip path between origins and destinations. Different methods of associating origin-destination demand from polygons with a street network were analyzed. These methods are particularly important where there are one-way restrictions and irregular street networks because of the assumptions they entail in relation to first- and last-segment travel. In a case study of Greater Boston, we found that with the current bike network, low-stress connectivity between homes and jobs would increase from 1.2\% to 8.7\% if one-way restrictions on local streets were eliminated. We also found that even with a dense mesh of low-stress main bike routes, connectivity would still be 16\% lower without contraflow on local streets than with. These results suggest that creating a network of main bike routes is not always enough; it is also important to provide contraflow on local streets. The Boston study also found that providing contraflow on selected links representing only 3\% of local one-way street mileage delivered 40\% of the connectivity impact of universal contraflow. Based on this finding, a method is proposed for prioritizing streets for contraflow conversion.}

  abstract = {Spatial accessibility to general hospitals is an important indicator of the convenience and ability of residents to obtain medical services. Therefore, developing a model for measuring accessibility to general hospitals by multiple transportation modes is necessary. In this study, considering that the increase in travel time will reduce the attractiveness of general hospitals, we used the Two-Step Floating Catchment Area with the Gaussian attenuation function, in which the supply was presented by capacity of hospitals (i.e., number of beds), and the demand was presented by population in each grid derived with social media data mapping real-time locations of active users. The Gaussian Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (Ga2SFCA) simulates the attenuation tendency of the general hospital service capabilities over transit time. To obtain a highly precise understanding of accessibility to hospitals, transit time on Baidu Maps' navigation service was used as the impedance condition, and the study area was divided into 1 square kilometer grids as the basic unit of research. Taking Nanjing city as a case study, it is found that the accessibility distribution shape changes from a multi-centered circular pattern to a multi-peak distribution, as the time threshold increases. By comparing the accessibility among 11 districts varying from main urban area to suburbs, the accessibility to general hospitals in Nanjing is significantly regionally unbalanced in both travel modes. By calculating and mapping the Modal Accessibility Gap (MAG) of the two travel modes, different modes of transportation resulted in different general hospital accessibility distributions. Generally, private car is superior in access to general hospitals to public transit in most areas. In the central area, public traffic may not contribute to the access to medical services as much as we thought, rather it plays a role in areas far from hospitals along metro lines and bus routes.}

Bikeshare systems have not captured high levels of ridership from disadvantaged populations, but there is some evidence that current bikeshare systems have specifically targeted certain populations to ensure sufficiently high demand for profitability. Far less attention has been paid to bikeshare programs' potential to provide greater access to jobs and essential services for disadvantaged communities. This paper uses two case study cities (Chicago and Philadelphia) to first, examine whether bikeshare systems have targeted specific populations, and to second, quantitatively assess the potential for bikeshare systems to provide greater accessibility for disadvantaged communities. Our results demonstrate that a well-designed bikeshare system can generate greater accessibility improvements for disadvantaged communities than the same system would produce for other populations. Using a newly developed spatial index that combines the potential for increased access to jobs and essential services, the level of bike infrastructure, and the disadvantaged population shares, we also find evidence that existing bikeshare systems have been specifically designed to target certain ridership. We find that locating stations in proximity to disadvantaged communities has the potential to increase household access (by bike and by bike-to-transit) to jobs and essential services and can close accessibility gaps between mobility constrained populations and critical services. The spatial index can be applied to identify potential locations to locate bikeshare stations (dock-based bikeshare systems) or rebalance bikes (dockless bikeshare systems) to address bikeshare equity issues.}

Using the poverty monitoring dataset and the multidimensional poverty indicator system, the uneven dynamics and regional disparity of multidimensional poverty and its driving factors in poverty-stricken areas in China during 2014-2018 are explored in this paper. The incidence rate of multidimensional poverty was reduced by 61.72\%, and the poverty reduction rate within the six dimensions ranged from 52.29 to 76.36\%. Multidimensional poverty and its six dimensions displayed narrowing regional disparity. Impoverished and moderately poor areas shrank, whereas low-poverty areas expanded. All 22 provinces have become low-poverty areas in 2018. The contribution of each dimension to multidimensional poverty varies for different types at different stages. Income and expenditure contribute the most to poverty status, followed by transportation, housing conditions, education, communication, and medical care and health. The contribution of each indicator among different dimensions varied with different trends from 2014 to2018. This paper helps incorporate the official minimums of "Two no worries and three guarantees" into a more operational evaluation system to promote sustainable policies for governments at all levels by 2020 and beyond, as well as provide valuable references for poverty alleviation in other developing countries worldwide.},

Representatives of four different sectors, which contribute to the decision making on transportation in Brazil, were used to find their different points of view about the criteria. With the main aim of prioritization of the criteria, it was considered one of the national policies of Brazilian transportation goals, i.e., the modal split balance of interurban cargo transportation. Thus, each expert provided a pair comparisons of the criteria and pondered their relative importance, attributing weights based upon the scale used by AHP. These comparisons do not consider which projects should be prioritized, but only the importance of each criterion in relation to the others. As a main result, the criterion “reduction of transportation costs” was presented in several scenarios as the most relevant.},

These are of particular relevance for those more likely to experience transport disadvantage, such as those in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas, where transport disadvantage tends to be higher. The aim of this study was to examine associations between neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage and transport-related spatial measures, identified through a review of transport-related policies. It included 2460 neighbourhoods in Brisbane, Australia as defined by the 2011 Australian national census boundaries. Neighbourhood socioeconomic disadvantage was measured using a census-derived composite index. Policy-relevant spatial measures included: street connectivity, cul-de-sac length, street block length, traffic volume, public transport stops and public transport frequency. Data were analysed using binary and multinomial logistic regression. More disadvantaged neighbourhoods had significantly greater odds of being highly connected, and with cul-de-sac and street block lengths, and public transport stop access and frequencies at levels recommended by Australian urban and transport policies, although they also had higher traffic volumes. Compared with more advantaged neighbourhoods, there was no evidence that disadvantaged neighbourhoods in Brisbane experience transport disadvantage. Although these neighbourhoods have higher levels of traffic, they are more likely to comprise urban and transport design features and levels of public transport access recommended by Australian urban and transport policies. The distribution of transport-related infrastructure in Brisbane has potential to reduce health inequities; and could potentially be enhanced further by reducing exposure to traffic.}

   abstract = {This paper aims at equity implications of transportation policies by using a range of equity measures in two case studies. Different measures of inequality embrace different normative judgments. Early studies have warned about placing too much trust in a single measure. One approach is to address equity considerations by assuming an explicit form of social welfare function and the choice of a desired inequality aversion parameter. A second approach is to apply an inequality measure to a given pair of distributions of a variable (e.g., income and accessibility) that changes as the result of a policy. The latter approach is adopted in this paper. A partial equilibrium model of transportation is used for the calculation of the changes in income, accessibility, and the net benefit for different social groups. This paper demonstrates the challenges that arise in addressing equity with a partial equilibrium model of transportation. An overview of some equity measures and their properties is provided first. The performances of these equity measures are evaluated for alternative road pricing schemes for Oslo, Norway. The paper illustrates that relating the equity objective to a predefined value of any of these measures is not desirable. It is difficult to make a judgment about the equity implication of a policy on the basis of a single measure and without a thorough examination of several measures. The paper also shows that the sizes of the equity measures are quite sensitive to the level of spatial disaggregation.},

We elaborate a conceptual framework for a comprehensive quantification of such an energy requirement, including the energy required to build out infrastructure to support these living standards. We interpret decent living as the consumption by households of a set of basic goods including adequate nutrition, shelter, health care, education, transport, refrigeration, television and mobile phones. We develop universal indicators for these activities and their infrastructure requirements, and specify a methodology to convert these to energy requirements using energy input-output analysis. Our main recommendations include estimating bottom-up, country-specific energy and emissions requirements, incorporating a minimum for methane emissions, and using international benchmarks at the sector level to encourage the reduction of countries' energy and emissions intensity.}

The research here is based on data from the Supplement on Disability and Use of Time for 2009, which specifically targeted senior couples with an average age of 68. With the use of scores to a set of satisfaction questions about life, health, memory, finances, and marriage, latent class clusters are estimated. This estimate leads to four distinct clusters of respondents that depend on the degree of happiness in each of the satisfaction questions. With the membership of each cluster as a dependent variable, ordered probit and multinomial logistic regression models are estimated to study the relationship between clusters and individual characteristics, including sociodemographics, activity patterns, time use, and use of active modes (walking-bicycling). The results show that respondents who engage in activities out of the home, socialize, and enjoy better mobility also report higher levels of subjective well-being leading to a better quality of life. The model findings also show that illness and pain are related to lower well-being and that quality of life in older age is correlated to mobility.}

The use of ridership performance criteria for route selection resulted in fewer impacts on routes with heavily minority or low-income populations. Quantitative analysis ensured that protected demographics were not significantly adversely affected by proposed service rationalizations. Route and frequency modifications and service span changes were evaluated with statistical t-tests during programming stages, resulting in proposals sensitive to equity concerns. Operationally, NYCT actively monitors service using U.S. census, survey, and routine agency data. The t-test and the chi-square test explicitly demonstrate racial and income equity in all aspects of agency operations on the basis of service standards and policies. As an example, t-tests compared the observed load factors with published guidelines; no significant differences in service delivery between demographic groups were found.}

Relative Desired Commute, on the other hand, was negatively related to amounts of actual commute and work-related travel, but positively related to travel liking and a measure of commute benefit. Overall, commute time is not unequivocally a source of disutility to be minimized, but rather offers some benefits (such as a transition between home and work). Most people have a non-zero optimum commute time, which can be violated in either direction - i.e. it is possible (although comparatively rare, occurring for only 7% of the sample) to commute too little. On the other hand, a large proportion of people (52% of the sample) are commuting longer than they would like, and hence would presumably be receptive to reducing (although usually not eliminating) that commute},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to ascertain the perceptions of health professionals who were located in six rural communities where hospital closure occured, regarding the impact of closure on community residents. These health professionals were asked to respond to questions about effects of hospital closures on the availability of medical services such as emergency care, physicians services, hospital services and nursing home care. To control for trends in medical services utilization that were unrelated to hospital closure, the study design included comparison areas where similar hospitals remained open. A standardized questionnaire was administered to three health professionals in each of the areas that experienced a hospital closure and also in the matched comparison areas. Interviews of the health professionals in closure areas provide evidence suggestive of some perceived negative effects of hospital closure on these communities. These negative effects include difficulty recruiting and retaining physicians, consern of residents about the loss of their local emergency room, and increased travel times to receive hospital services. The perceived effects of closure appeared to be mediated by the distances required for travel to the nearest hospital. Respondents perceived increased travel times to most significantly affect vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, the disabled and the economically disadvantaged. Respondants in the majority of comparison areas also reported access barriers for vulnerable populations. These barriers primarily center on problems of obtaining transportation and enduring the rigors of travel. Improvements in the availability of transportation to medical care may offer some stabilization to communities where hospitals closed; however, it also is the case that transportation improvements are needed to increase access to care in rural communities where hospitals remained open.}

  abstract = {This study reveals that only marginal improvements have occurred with respect to evacuation planning in America’s 50 largest cities, during the past decade since Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans in 2005. The hurricane revealed a lack of preparedness, specifically to evacuate carless and vulnerable populations. This paper analyzes the state of evacuation planning in America’s fifty largest cities in 2015/2016 and compares plans to those in the same cities a decade earlier. Findings include 17 major cities do not have evacuation plans, down from 24 cities in 2005/2006. Plans in 16 cities mention carless and vulnerable populations and 13 plans described, in-detail, plans for evacuating such populations. These metrics are up slightly from a decade earlier. The paper also presents an Evacuation Preparedness Rating System, which includes five dimensions, identified as best practices in evacuation planning for vulnerable populations. The dimensions examine each plan with regard to: 1. Special needs registries, 2. Specialized transportation plans for individuals with specific needs, 3. Pick-up location plan, 4. Multimodal evacuation plan, and 5. Pedestrian evacuation plan. The paper reports scores for each dimension and then presents a composite score for each city. This study lends support to the theory that cities do not develop strong evacuation plans, ones that accommodate the needs of all people, unless they have already experienced a major disaster or under a threat. While it is promising that more cities are developing evacuation plans, overall it remains disheartening that not every city was able to learn the lessons of not being prepared, especially for carless and vulnerable populations, as showcased to the nation during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.}

Public transport accessibility concerns of the access level of geographical locations to public transport. In this paper, accessibility is used as an indicator to estimate social exclusion based on the maximum distance that someone has to walk to reach the public transport. The concept of the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) is applied to measure accurately the walking ability for different groups of the population. A real life case study is conducted to get insight into the transportation network of the Porto Metropolitan Area, Portugal. For this purpose, geographic, demographic and infrastructure data were collected and integrated. Also, webservices are used to measure walking distances between locations. The results of this study allowed to characterize regions by different levels of accessibility, providing insight into the social exclusion in public transport. This assessment is used not only to identify inequities but also to get an overview of the service quality of public transport.},

In this paper, we present an approach for designing homogeneous zones optimising the spatial distribution of an area-level exposure, active living potential (ALP), based on data collected in Montreal, Canada. The objectives are to (1) assess and compare variation in walking behaviours between these purposefully designed zones and between standard administrative units, census tracts; and (2) disentangle the relative influence of ALP and area-level socioeconomic conditions on walking using the alternative geographies. Zones were designed by statistically classifying smallest census areas (disseminations areas) into seven categories of exposure similar along three indicators of ALP: population density, land use mix, and geographic accessibility to services. Mapping of categories resulted in the delineation of zones characterised by one of seven levels of ALP. A sample of 2716 adults aged {$>$}= 45 years was geocoded and cross-classified in 270 zones and 112 census tracts. individuals reported on minutes and motives of walking and provided socioeconomic information. Data were analysed using cross-classified multilevel models. Variation in utilitarian walking was larger across the purposefully defined zones than across census tracts. Total walking varied significantly between census tracts only. Greater ALP was associated with more utilitarian walking but with less recreational walking. Higher socioeconomic position in census tracts was positively associated with total, utilitarian, and recreational walking. The soundness of standard administrative units for measuring ecologic exposure and their associations with health should be considered prior to conducting analyses. The added value of different approaches for understanding how place relates to health remains to be established and should be the focus of further investigations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Understanding and recognizing the different transportation conditions and mobility behavior of low-income groups is extremely important for developing and delivering sustainable transportation systems (Lucas et al. 2016). Herein the authors deepen the understanding of transportation affordability in Latin America and the Caribbean ({LAC}), with a focus on urban public transportation.  The analysis of household expenditure on transportation by expenditure quintile shows that rich households in {LAC} spent a larger percentage of their expenditure on transportation (17.1 percent) than poorer households (7.7 percent) (Gandelman, Serebrisky, and Suárez-Alemán 2018). Also, as total expenditure increases, expenditure on private transportation increases. Measurement of transportation expenditure may not capture the transportation affordability problem of low-income groups, because fare evasion is higher in deprived areas and poor people may avoid some motorized trips because they are too expensive. The authors build a transportation affordability indicator and rank cities in accordance to their performance. The results show that the financial burden of a basket of transportation trips for the bottom income quintile exceeds 25 percent in half of the analyzed cities for the 60-trip basket. Transportation subsidies are the most common policy implemented in the region to increase the affordability of transportation, especially for low-income groups. However, their impact in the region has been mixed, showing the need of improving their implementation, particularly in terms of their distributional impacts.},

This lack of transport imposes severe constraints on their access to health, education, and other social facilities and services, making them and their children more vulnerable to serious injury or death as a result of childbirth or another medical emergency. Understanding and responding to women’s transport needs are essential for reducing poverty, as reflected in the United Nations statement of the Millennium Development Goals. Many governments and development agencies have learned much from extensive field research and case studies about women’s and men’s substantially different patterns of mobility needs. In recent years, the World Bank has integrated these gender concerns and needs into its policies and has encouraged borrowing countries to address the concerns of women in their national, regional, and local projects and programs. The World Bank has developed corresponding guidance for the transport sector and encourages its application as appropriate in all the transport investments that it supports. This paper summarizes examples of good practice and illustrates its application in Ethiopia. However, the World Bank’s Transport Sector is concerned that the outcomes for women of the interventions that it supports often continue to fall short of expectations. This paper describes the steps that are being taken to improve the effective meeting of gender needs. The paper also highlights the value of participating in a broad network of development specialist groups to share experience of effective good practices and to strengthen the scope for matching specific cultural and institutional conditions.}

Moreover, exclusion increases the costs associated with disability to constrain disabled people from breaking out of poverty. Improved access and mobility are important factors in reducing poverty and can facilitate the participation of people with disabilities in economic, social and political processes. Many countries have legislation requiring that these challenges be addressed but effective responses are generally very limited. Action to improve the situation is constrained by the serious shortage of data on the access and mobility needs of disabled and elderly people as well as by resource constraints. This paper outlines guidance for addressing the access and mobility needs of disabled and elderly people in the context of the World Bank’s mission to reduce poverty and discusses the main challenges for providing inclusive transport. It draws attention to opportunities to learn from transport interventions and to current research. The paper describes the main activities being fostered by the Transport Sector in the World Bank. These aim to raise awareness of proven good practice in setting policies and strategies. The authors also contribute to a community of practice which draws on current and new experience to improve planning, design and implementation for inclusive transport in developing countries.}

  abstract = {Double energy vulnerability (DEV) is the increased likelihood of negative impacts upon well-being, owing to the intersection of domestic energy poverty (DEP) and transport energy poverty (TEP). Whilst considerable research has focused on the geography of DEP, similar issues of transport-related energy costs have received less attention, reflecting entrenched disciplinary and sectoral boundaries. This is despite transport accounting for a high proportion of household energy consumption and expenditure amongst specific vulnerable populations and locales. Meanwhile, owing to the prevalence of fossil fuels in domestic and transport energy, both are affected by changes in fuel prices. Subsequently, selected households face high expenditure on both domestic and transport energy. Focusing on a case study of England, this paper analyses the geographical distribution of DEP and TEP, and the extent to which the two intersect. Two neighbourhood-scale analyses shed light on the geographies of DEV, using three existing DEP and TEP indicators. Firstly, we identify significant clusters of neighbourhoods with a high or low propensity to DEV using a Local Moran's I statistic. Secondly, we identify neighbourhoods in the highest and lowest quantiles for multiple DEP and TEP indicators. Our results illustrate that as many as 6\% of neighbourhoods (accounting for 3 million residents) have a high propensity towards DEV depending on the indicators selected, typically concentrating in isolated, rural neighbourhoods. We discuss our findings in light of the role that lack of access to networked energy and transport infrastructures plays in aggravating energy poverty in both domains. The findings support a cross-sectoral policy approach to tackle the issue of DEV.}

A state-of-the-practice regional travel demand model is used to simulate the travel effects of the APTS technologies in the Sacramento region for the year 2015. A method of obtaining consumer welfare is applied to the mode choice models in the travel model. It was found that APTS technologies, which were simulated in this study to act as feeder service for light rail and bus transit, did not significantly reduce congestion and emissions in the region. This was primarily because the Sacramento region lacks extensive penetration by light rail and bus service. The consumer welfare evaluation, however, showed that all the APTS technology scenarios yielded an economic benefit and were generally equitable even when capital, operation, and maintenance costs were included in the analysis. Further, the analysis showed that advanced transit information service alone produced the greatest increase in consumer welfare. The total yearly difference in benefits among the scenarios would be significant. Thus, it is concluded that the method of obtaining consumer welfare used in this study is a useful analytical tool for identifying optimal bundles of APTS technologies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The aim of the study was to explore population density and transport time to hospital care as possible predictors of geographical differences in mortality rates, and to what extent choice of statistical method might affect the analytical results and accompanying clinical conclusions.Methods Using data from the Norwegian Cause of Death registry, deaths from external causes 1998-2007 were analysed. Norway consists of 434 municipalities, and municipality population density and travel time to hospital care were entered as predictors of municipality mortality rates in univariate and multiple regression models of increasing model complexity. We fitted linear regression models with continuous and categorised predictors, as well as piecewise linear and generalised additive models (GAMs). Models were compared using Akaike's information criterion (AIC).Results Population density was an independent predictor of trauma mortality rates, while the contribution of transport time to hospital care was highly dependent on choice of statistical model. A multiple GAM or piecewise linear model was superior, and similar, in terms of AIC. However, while transport time was statistically significant in multiple models with piecewise linear or categorised predictors, it was not in GAM or standard linear regression.Conclusions Population density is an independent predictor of trauma mortality rates. The added explanatory value of transport time to hospital care is marginal and model-dependent, highlighting the importance of exploring several statistical models when studying complex associations in observational data.},

However, accessibility to opportunities for people who cycle is not necessarily the same across socioeconomically different population segments, and it tends to be further constrained by high costs associated with the travel distance through the road network. This research examines equality in the accessibility to employment and education among cycle-user adults in Bogota. Using 968 reported bicycle trips with these travel purposes in the 2015 Bogota Household Travel Survey, we estimate a potential accessibility indicator and horizontal and vertical equality indicators. First, we identify three clusters through the K-prototypes method to classify bicycle commuters based on trip and socioeconomic characteristics, and second, we calculate potential accessibility using GIS-based trip distance decay functions, which is later assessed through equality indices such as Lorenz Curves, Gini index and Palma Ratio. Results show marked differences in potential accessibility to work and study opportunities between and within clusters, where up to 90\% of the analyzed population of a cyclists' cluster has access to 30\% of the job and study opportunities, indicating social and spatial inequalities produced by the urban structure and individual and household characteristics of regular cyclists. Results can guide in the implementation of accurate transport policies towards more equitable and sustainable transport in cities that are experiencing increases in bicycle ridership.}

The methodology can be used to formalize the conceptual schema of the three dimensions of sustainable development widely referred to in literature as the “three pillars of sustainability”. The method works on three different levels. At the first level, three fuzzy inference systems produce three sustainability indicators (social, economic and environmental), each using respective input variables (indicators commonly used for evaluation processes in the field of transportation systems analysis), and respective inference rules formulated by experts. At the second level, the fuzzy variables representing social, economic and environmental sustainability of the action become inputs for three different inference systems (based on rules formulated by experts), the outputs of the inference systems are indicators of equity (social/economic dimension), viability (economic/environmental dimension) and bearableness (social/environmental dimension). At the third level, the fuzzy variables produced from the previous level become input variables for an inference system, again based on set rules, which can be used to compose the different dimensions (social, economic and environmental) and deliver, as the final output, a fuzzy indicator of the durability and sustainability offered by the action plan.}

The surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations during 2020 also underscored the fact that accessibility to nearby hospitals for testing and treatment and vaccination sites is crucial for patients with fever or respiratory symptoms. Although necessary, quantifying healthcare access is challenging as it depends on a complex interaction between underlying socioeconomic and physical factors. In this case study, the authors deployed a Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach to uncover the barriers and their effect on healthcare access using an accessibility index. Using the least cost path (LCP) analysis the authors quantified the cost associated with healthcare access from each census block group in the Los Angeles metropolitan area (LA Metro) to the nearest hospital. Social vulnerability reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the daily number of COVID-19 cases from the Los Angeles open data portal and built environment characteristics (slope of the street, car ownership, population density distribution, walkability, traffic collision density, and speed limit) were used to quantify accessibility. The results showed that the census block groups with a social vulnerability index above 0.75 (high vulnerability) had low accessibility owing to the higher cost of access to nearby hospitals and were also coincident with the hotspots for COVID-19 cases and deaths. The findings highlighted the inequitable exposure of socially disadvantaged populations to COVID-19 infections and how the pandemic impacts were exacerbated by the synergistic effect of socioeconomic status and built environment characteristics of the locations where the disadvantaged populations resided. The framework proposed herein could be adapted to geo-target testing/vaccination sites and improve accessibility to healthcare facilities in general and among the socially vulnerable populations to reduce the health risk.}

This qualitative research took a feminist intersectional approach and interviewed 49 women in six focus groups, to explore their experiences as women who knew how to cycle, and wished to cycle more. Participants, who were all based in one city, included two ethnic groups (Māori and non-Māori) and three age groups (adolescents, mothers with children at home, and older women), giving a range over the life-course and including an innovative study of Māori women's cycling. Topics covered included learning to ride as a child, experiences with traffic, topography and other local issues, feelings about cycling and taking an imagined ride. Results revealed the challenge and joys of cycling, what is normal and not normal in cycling, and a double or triple burden affecting women in terms of safety: perceptions of traffic danger; personal safety as women; and the need to be safety-conscious because of responsibilities for others. Differences between Māori and non-Māori arose in context of varying household types, access to bicycles and cultural perspectives on cycling. Participants were clear about how to support women cycling: safe and connected cycling infrastructure, and systems that normalise women's cycling, with national and local government policies to support these.}

  abstract = {Accessibility is increasingly recognised as a key purpose of transport policies. Most of the common practices found both in academic studies and policy planning draw on relatively simple accessibility measures taken as 'objective' indicators that only focus on the interaction between land use and transport. Relatively little attention has been paid to heterogeneity in individual characteristics and in self-reported perceptions of accessibility ('subjective' indicators), and the corresponding differences with respect to available modal options. This study includes a comparison of (1) 'objective' indicators of accessibility to key activities by various modes of transport; and (2) individuals' own perceptions of their capability to access valuable out-of-home activities and the modal options available to them. This study examines the key differences between the two representations of accessibility. The calculated measure was developed using door-to-door travel times to supermarkets and healthcare centres using OpenTripPlanner. The self-reported measure was based on a dedicated capability-oriented travel survey of people aged 65-79 in Sweden's large metropolitan regions: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo center dot. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and binary and multinomial logistic regressions. The results of this study allow us to gain a greater insight into the ways in which the two accounts differ and can complement one another. We find that conventional methods, by overlooking the heterogeneity in people's perceptions of their accessibility, tend to overestimate accessibility levels and underestimate accessibility inequalities. This study shows how perceived accounts of accessibility can be incorporated into conventional accessibility models and improve accessibility analyses.}

An important cost that is usually overlooked in measuring location affordability is the transportation or accessibility costs. In this paper, we present a modeling approach, driven by urban open data, to measure location affordability that incorporates both housing and transportation costs. We apply the developed model to assess housing affordability in Melbourne, Australia as a case study. Results suggest that neighbourhoods that appear to be affordable when only housing cost is considered are not necessarily affordable when transportation costs are taken into account. A negative correlation between housing affordability and transportation affordability is observed. We also identify the presence of a strong spatial clustering pattern in the affordability measure across the study area. A major methodological contribution of the paper is the inclusion of comprehensive private vehicle costs and public transportation expenses in the model that contributes to a more robust estimation and understanding of location affordability. The model also distinguishes between different trip purposes. Results suggest that plans and policies to improve housing affordability should be made in coordination with transportation infrastructure investment plans to ensure effective and equitable outcomes. Nevertheless, the focus of the paper is more on the measurement of affordability; rather than reviewing and recommending housing related policies.}

Recent studies, however, reveal that gender and equity issues are highly problematic, pointing to tensions between environmental and social sustainability. Given these tensions, a university-community collaboration, the Laboratory for Social Change, developed a pilot methodology to define and evaluate Transport Justice. We sought a relatively simple instrument, a Transport Justice report (Balance de Transporte Justo, BTJ) that could combine experiential and academic knowledge and thereby influence policy and decision-making more effectively. We used a participatory action research (PAR) approach to bring together community leaders and university researchers, and consider experiential and research data, through this "transport justice" lens. To start, we introduced the idea of "transport justice" with researchers in different disciplines and citizen organizations involved in relatively specific battles: fighting a highway, for better cycling facilities, or for reduced road speeds, for example. We focused on established issues, such as universal access, walkability, cycle-inclusion, but added children's freedom and autonomy, the wise city (older adults, heritage, identity), care and land use, and transport impacts on ecological services. Building on this collaboration, we also applied a transport justice survey in two contrasting Chilean cities, Santiago and Temuco. Our analysis reveals that, despite a planning system that favours high-income households whose members rely mainly on cars, the majority of pedestrians, cyclists, public transit and even car users would prefer a redistribution of road space and investment in favour of active transport. During the next phase of research (2020-2021), we will test how well these results are taken up by citizen organizations, politicians and senior government staff from all parties. This will allow us to evaluate its effectiveness as a policy and power distributing instrument.},

Although there have been many studies conducted that have measured access levels to public transport stops/stations, there has been limited research on measuring accessibility that integrates population density within geographical areas. This study develops a new measure that considers public transport service frequency and population density as an important distributional indicator. A public transport accessibility index (PTAI) is formulated for quantifying accessibility within local areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. A public transport network model is applied to identify the service coverage of public transport modes using a Geographical Information System (GIS). A consistent method is introduced for evaluating public transport accessibility for different levels of analysis, from single elements, including public mode stops to network analysis. The Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) is used to evaluate the index and examine the association between commuting trips undertaken by public transport and the level of accessibility within the Melbourne metropolitan region. Furthermore, the new index is compared with two existing approaches using the VISTA dataset. Key findings indicate that the PTAI had a stronger association whilst showing more use of public transport in areas with higher values of the PTAI. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

The results of this analysis suggest that net personal transportation system benefits ai-e not significantly biased toward particular income or racial groups. As might be expected, the results indicate that there is a positive relationship between urban location and access to transportation facilities. The analysis of the distributional equity of transportation services presented in this article represents a departure from previous research efforts. Such efforts have tended to measure equity as a function of outputs from service provision activities rather than outcomes, which are the social and economic changes resulting from service provision. These findings have important policy implications for transportation impact analysis, especially in the area of social impact analysis.}

	abstract = {Introduction: Interventions for the Saving Mothers, Giving Life ({SMGL}) initiative aimed to ensure all pregnant women in {SMGL}-supported districts have timely access to emergency obstetric and newborn care ({EmONC}). Spatial travel-time analyses provide a visualization of changes in timely access.
Methods: We compared travel-time estimates to {EmONC} health facilities in {SMGL}-supported districts in western Uganda in 2012, 2013, and 2016. To examine {EmONC} access, we analyzed a categorical variable of travel-time duration in 30-minute increments. Data sources included health facility assessments, geographic coordinates of {EmONC} facilities, geolocated population estimates of women of reproductive age ({WRA}), and other road network and geographic sources.
Results: The number of {EmONC} facilities almost tripled between 2012 and 2016, increasing geographic access to {EmONC}. Estimated travel time to {EmONC} facilities declined significantly during the 5-year period. The proportion of {WRA} able to access any {EmONC} and comprehensive {EmONC} ({CEmONC}) facility within 2 hours by motorcycle increased by 18\% (from 61.3\% to 72.1\%, P {\textless} .01) and 37\% (from 51.1\% to 69.8\%, P {\textless} .01), respectively from baseline to 2016. Similar increases occurred among {WRA} accessing {EmONC} and {CEmONC} respectively if 4-wheeled vehicles (14\% and 31\% increase, P {\textless} .01) could be used. Increases in timely access were also substantial for nonmotorized transportation such as walking and/or bicycling.
Conclusions: Largely due to the {SMGL}-supported expansion of {EmONC} capability, timely access to {EmONC} significantly improved. Our analysis developed a geographic outline of facility accessibility using multiple types of transportation. Spatial travel-time analyses, along with other {EmONC} indicators, can be used by planners and policy makers to estimate need and target underserved populations to achieve further gains in {EmONC} accessibility. In addition to increasing the number and geographic distribution of {EmONC} facilities, complementary efforts to make motorized transportation available are necessary to achieve meaningful increases in {EmONC} access.},

By assessing the supply of public transport for city accessibility, a considerable variation within each city can be seen. Of interest is the extent to which there is a relationship between the quality of public transport accessibility and the spatial distribution of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. This paper examines this issue by mapping spatial data on socioeconomic disadvantage and advantage against indicators of public transport accessibility. The findings show that Australian cities are characterized by a significant level of spatially manifested socioeconomic inequality exacerbated by transport disadvantage. It is argued that a coincidence of public transport infrastructure and service improvements as well as urban intensification and housing affordability policies are required to counteract these trends.}

Built environmental factors and parental safety concerns are well-known to predict the level of independent mobility adults grant to children. In contrast, the influence of adults' socio-demographic characteristics and neighbourhood social cohesion on children's independent mobility is largely unexplored. This study investigated the influence of adults' socio-demographic factors and neighbourhood social cohesion on distances they would permit children for independent travel and outdoor play.Methods: In 2013, a random sample of 1293 Australian adults (mean age: 56.1 years, 52 \% male, 81 \% parents) participated in the Queensland Social Survey (QSS) via computer-assisted telephone interview. Socio-demographic factors measured included age, sex, parental status, education and area-level socio-economic disadvantage. Perceived neighbourhood social cohesion was assessed using a standardised scale. Adults reported the distances children aged 8-12 years should be allowed to walk/cycle to places, and play outdoors without adults. Responses were categorised into 'within sight', {$<$} 0.5 kilometres (km), 0.5-1 km and {$>$} 1 km. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess associations of socio-demographic factors and neighbourhood social cohesion with distances adults would permit for children's independent travel and outdoor play.Results: Parents and adults with lower education were less likely to permit greater distances for children's independent travel (OR = 0.57 and OR = 0.59, respectively). Women, parents and adults with lower education were less likely to grant children greater distances for independent outdoor play (OR = 0.61, OR = 0.50 and OR = 0.60, respectively). In contrast, adults with higher perceptions of neighbourhood social cohesion were more likely to permit children greater distances for independent travel (OR = 1.05) and outdoor play (OR = 1.05). Adult age and area-level socio-economic disadvantage were not associated with distances adults would permit for independent travel and outdoor play.Conclusions: Women, parents (particularly those of younger children), adults with lower education and those who perceived neighbourhood social cohesion as being lower were less willing to let children independently travel further away from home. Interventions to increase children's independent mobility may be more effective if targeted to these groups. In addition, increasing neighbourhood social cohesion may help increase adults' willingness to grant children greater independent mobility.}

The AIs were based on a formulation relating travel time and cost between specified origins and destinations (O-Ds).  Wider use of the role of the indices was examined, particularly for reducing car dependency as one element in improving sustainability within the North East Hampshire Transport Strategy.  The indices, which can be presented in simplified graphical fashion to inform nontechnical audiences, are based on door-to-door travel times and costs, and the O-Ds represent trips between home and important destinations.  Significantly, the only example in which travel-cost AIs for bus versus car travel were approximately equal was that in which a substantial car-parking charge was made.  The AIs thus help to indicate the transport corridors where actions to improve equity in transport opportunities for users have the greatest priority and potential.  These actions, such as improved bus priority and varying fare levels, parking charges, and other user charges, can be verified by prescriptive use of the AIs to illustrate the impacts.  This approach provides a basis for using the AIs to quickly examine future transport scenarios and in associated decision making.  It also helps in focusing on detailed modal shift analysis aimed at reshaping the transport system in a sustainable manner.  This process is described within the context of strategic transport planning at county and regional levels, and continuing work on the theory and applications of the AIs is outlined.},

It poses potential adverse impacts to civil infrastructure, with consequences that include increased financial resources, economic impacts, social impacts, and planning issues. This paper aims to enhance and broaden the discussion on sustainability and the importance of the consideration of social, environmental, and technical aspects in relation to infrastructure planning. Particularly under climate change, these considerations allow for more holistic, effective, and long-term benefits to communities and economies. This paper introduces the triple bottom line (TBL) approach to sustainability as a framework for holistic infrastructure planning under the uncertainty of climate change. The economic pillar will focus on the impacts of climate change on road infrastructure and the cost-benefit of potential adaptation options; environmental considerations include quantifying the potential increase in GHG emissions from increased roadworks required by climate change damages; and the social pillar will be quantified using an index based upon the SoVI method. Each of these 'pillars' of sustainability will be analyzed individually and mapped using geographic information systems (GIS). Finally, a 'holistic' approach will be discussed, where these individual layers are combined using GIS to display the information. A case study focused on the Sacramento Region of California is used as a proof-of-concept for how the triple bottom line framework introduced here can be utilized to provide actionable, more equitable decision-making for investment in critical infrastructure adaptation policy.}

This research examines the interconnected impact of infrastructure systems on existing spatial inequities through a study in metropolitan Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This study investigates whether the urban-rural (U-R) gradient concept can enhance understanding of the spatial relationship between socioeconomic indicators and infrastructure systems. Indicators of spatial inequalities were regressed against infrastructure variables and imperviousness, as a proxy for the U-R gradient, using multivariate and spatial regression methods. The models show that imperviousness has a positive correlation with the concentration of racialized minorities and a negative correlation with access to health insurance. The study also shows that the predictive power of multiple infrastructures varies across space and does not adhere to urban boundaries or the U-R gradient. The complex interactions among different infrastructures shape inequities and require further inquiry in urban regions around the world.}

  abstract = {Public transport plays an important role in a city's economy and its social equity. It is also instrumental in reducing automobile dependence and traffic congestion. Several factors must come together to achieve well-functioning public transport systems. One major factor is the level of accessibility offered by the public transport system. To better understand and consequentially enhance accessibility, we must be able to measure it and map it, which is the key aim of this paper.The methodology in this study, which was originally developed by the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham and later adopted by Transport for London (TfL) has been adapted to the case study city of Ahmedabad, India. A GIS mapping tool was used to generate a visual representation of public transport accessibility levels (PTAL) taking into account average walk speed and time, distances to public transport stops, and peak-hour route frequencies of different public transport modes. The paper concludes with initiation of a discussion on the potential uses of PTAL mapping to enhance planning practice, such as formulating development/master plans with land use-transport integration, prioritizing public transport and supporting investments, formulating parking policies, and developing transit-oriented zoning regulations.}

This study aims to uncover the dynamics of modal preferences while the Mobility-on-Demand (MoD) services operate in the market. Using the 2017 National Household Travel Survey data, a Multiple Discrete Continuous Extreme Value model is developed to analyze the dynamics of individuals' modality style. This model enables us to take into consideration marginal rates of substitutions between different transportation modes. Variables of interest in this analysis include the frequency of use of mobility-on-demand (MoD) services as well as the frequency of walking, biking, transit, and auto trips over the course of a month. The results of this study offer city planners and policymakers an opportunity to better understand the factors underlying modality styles, and which priorities to focus on when designing a sustainable development plan for resident-centric Smart Cities. According to the results, age, work status, education, auto availability, and the built environments are among the significant contributors to the modality styles. The results also indicate that the extent of the substitution relationship between transit and MoD services is highly context dependent.}

The objective of this paper is to analyze which type of public transport service best fit the periphery and compare alternative services based on a set of quantities and qualitative measures with emphasize on equity considerations. We applied for the first time the Potential Mobility Index (PMI) developed by Martens (2016) to analyze the equity implications of the alternatives. We applied it in a new and unique way with two measures of travel time: in-vehicle travel time and door to door travel time. The research applies the methodology to a case study of Israel's peripheral cities. Two different alternative services were analyzed: high-speed rail to the Northern and Southern peripheral cities, and a fix schedule regional BRT shuttle service with a timed transfer to rail hubs near the periphery.The accessibility measures show that the rail service to the periphery provides high accessibility, however, the demand analysis suggests that the demand would be low to justify high-speed rail service. The analysis of the in-vehicle time PMI shows an advantage to the high-speed rail alternative, however, the door to door calculation of PMI shows that the BRT service gives better PMI scores to all the peripheral cities that we examined and can be effective in providing a high quality of service to the periphery. The results provide some insights for research and service planning in rural areas and found some generalization to equity aspects in the periphery dilemma.}

Inequity in access to government healthcare facilities affects the overall urban population and can substantially negatively impact the vulnerable population, who mostly rely on government healthcare services. In this paper, the accessibility measure for healthcare services by public transport is developed using travel time and the number of transit stops (accounting for transit connectivity) for Greater Mumbai. We also identified socially vulnerable wards (administrative units) using a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), developed based on 16 indicators using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Developed regression models showed that the proposed accessibility measure explains the coverage and usage of healthcare services better than the traditional accessibility measure, which is based on only aggregate level travel time impedances. South Mumbai has relatively better accessibility for public hospitals and dispensaries, whereas, lower level of accessibility is observed in the eastern part for public healthcare services. Assessment for the spatial inequity based on the Gini index, bivariate Moran's I, and mean access value reveals a higher degree of spatial inequity for accessing government hospitals for the slum population. The study developed a decision framework to suggest effective policy measures, which can be prioritised based on SVI to reduce the disparity in the spatial distribution of accessibility to government healthcare systems for vulnerable groups. Our findings can aid transportation and urban planners, health researchers, and policymakers to improve accessibility in under-served areas and give special attention to the needs of the vulnerable population.}

Lack of adequate access to educational services to children can affect their overall well-being. Further, an inadequate supply of educational opportunities can reinforce social inequalities. This research develops a conceptual framework to measure accessibility for educational services using an extensive dataset of mode-wise travel time matrix of 577 Traffic Analysis Zones (TAZ) and 4308 schools in Greater Mumbai. We evaluated spatial and social equity from urban and transportation planning perspectives for access to educational services. The Gini index is used to assess the distribution of educational accessibility and quantify the spatial inequity. Social inequity is quantified based on the mode-wise accessibility ratio for educational services. The average accessibility ratio shows that the gap in access by public transport and private mode reduces as the threshold increases. A decision framework is developed based on accessibility measures, and policy measures are suggested to address the existing inequities. This study can help planners and policymakers effectively prioritise the suggested measures to maximise the benefits and address spatial and social inequities for access to educational services.}

This paper develops an optimization model to examine the accessibility from single family homes to major urban facilities for services or amenities using geographical information systems. The home-based accessibility to facilities is based upon the point to point direct distance from sampled homes to sampled facilities. Descriptive statistics about the accessibility, such as min/max, mean/median, and standard deviation/variance were computed. Variations of accessibility for a range of categories by home price and year built were also examined. Multivariate linear regression models examining the housing value with respect to home-facility accessibility by facility types were implemented. The results show that desirable urban facilities, which are also more frequently used for livability, enjoy better accessibility than undesirable urban facilities. The home-based accessibility's positive or negative associations with home price along with year built and/or residential lot size exist for most facilities in general, and by confirming to the literature, the home-facility accessibility in particular does strongly impact home values as evidenced by fair to excellent R-2 values. Accordingly, this research provides evidence-based recommendations for sustainable urban mobility and urban planning.}

The prerequisite for achieving this goal is that citizens should be able to access county hospitals' services conveniently and impartially. However, little research has been done on the actual levels of the spatial accessibility of citizens to county hospitals in Western China. Therefore, we aimed to measure the spatial accessibility to county hospitals for county residents and to identify any regional disparities in Shaanxi Province in Western China. Methods We implemented a novel method - involving utilizing navigation data from the AutoNavi web mapping system (knows as Gaode map in Chinese) - to assess the time and distance from villages and neighborhoods to the county hospitals. The navigation data were collected by request through an application-programming-interface using a web crawler (web data extraction tool) in Python. The shortest driving time and distance were extracted from the navigation data. The travel impedance to the nearest provider (TINP) indicator was used to measure spatial accessibility. Results The results show that county residents in Western China's Shaanxi Province have poor spatial accessibility to county hospitals. Only 68.8\% of villages and neighborhoods are within 60 min travel time (based on driving mode) to a county hospital, while 13.4\% of such villages and neighborhoods are beyond 90 min travel time. Moreover, a significant within-province disparity exists, with residents in the central area enjoying the best accessibility to county hospitals, while the northern and southern areas still need improvements in accessibility. Conclusions Focused health resource planning is required to improve the spatial accessibility to county hospitals and to eliminate regional disparities. Further studies are called for to integrate the navigation data of web mapping systems with GIS methods to the measure spatial accessibility of health facilities in more complex contexts.}

The indicators are estimated at the level of the traffic analysis zone (TAZ) and include: (1) the average level of emissions generated per individual and (2) the level of emissions occurring in a zone as a proxy for air pollution exposure. A regional traffic assignment model is extended with capabilities for emission modeling at an individual trip level while taking into account vehicle (type and age) and trip attributes (road type, speed, and volume). We observe that individuals who generate higher emissions from travel tend to reside in areas with lower exposure to traffic emissions while individuals associated with low levels of travel emissions (e.g. travel smaller distances, conduct less trips, and use alternative modes) reside in areas with high levels of traffic pollution. A regression analysis of the two indicators against a set of land-use and socio-economic variables shows that generated emissions per individual are positively associated with car ownership and larger vehicles, while being negatively associated with ownership of newer vehicles, and location in dense and walkable neighborhoods with high levels of commercial land-use. Meanwhile, exposure to emissions is positively associated with dense and walkable neighborhoods and negatively associated with car ownership and larger vehicles. These findings indicate major inequities in the generation of and exposure to traffic-related air pollution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Some minority groups may have less access or are deprived of access to green spaces when compared with the rest of the population. The availability of public green spaces may also be directly related to the geographical location of the city within Europe. In addition, current planning for urban regeneration and the creation of new high-quality recreational public green spaces sometimes results in projects that reinforce the paradox of green gentrification. The aim of this study was to explore the concept of environmental justice in the distribution of the public green spaces in two contrasting cities, Tartu, Estonia; and Faro, Portugal. Quantitative indicators of public green space were calculated in districts in each city. The accessibility of those spaces was measured using the "walkability" distance and grid methods. The results revealed that there was more availability and accessibility to public green spaces in Tartu than in Faro. However, inequalities were observed in Soviet-era housing block districts in Tartu, where most of the Russian minority live, while Roma communities in Faro were located in districts without access to public green space. The availability of public green spaces varied from 1.22 to 31.44 m(2)/inhabitant in the districts of Faro, and 1.04 to 164.07 m(2)/inhabitant in the districts of Tartu. In both cities, 45\% of the inhabitants had accessible public green spaces within 500 m of their residence. The development of targeted new green infrastructure could increase access to 88\% of the population for the city of Faro and 86\% for Tartu, delivering environmental justice without provoking green gentrification. The outcome of this study provides advice to urban planners on how to balance green space distribution within city neighbourhoods.}

Although PPG 6 has supported some successes in achieving objectives relating to accessibility of services by public transport, walking and cycling, and has supported some central areas, the overall picture is one of continued aggravation of the problems identified in it, principally the decline of many central areas, increasing problems of accessibility to services and deteriorating environmental quality. PIPS 6 places greater emphasis on analysing relationships between central areas and on assessing development needs. These changes will help clarify the problems but will need the support of other policies outside PPS 6, in particular policies relating to the amount of travel. Increasing travel over many years has been accompanied by polarisation of central areas; the decline of many commercial centres, especially the smaller ones, is causing social exclusion, deteriorating performance on sustainability criteria, and results in greater demands for expenditure on transport infrastructure. A case study of Dudley in the West Midlands examines how the guidance might help a town centre severely affected by decline since the mid 1980s.}

The study was carried out as a mail survey among Finnish citizens aged 65 and above (N = 2500). The response rate was 62\%. The results showed that older women did not have the option to drive as often as men did.

The results imply that the intersection of both gender and age regimes create different standards for personal mobility for older women than for older men. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the main themes is accessible physical environment that has major impacts on mobility, independence and quality of life of older adults, and their ability to "age in place".Mobility of older adults is conducive to their physical, emotional, and social wellbeing. Mobility patterns of older adults, how built environment impacts older adults' mobility have been well-studied by academics. These studies often required advanced research technique and substantial data collection; it is challenging to incorporate these study approaches into the Age-Friendly City (AFC) framework that emphasizes bottom-up participation of stakeholders. On the other hand, studies led by local stakeholders often relied too much on subjective data sources. To facilitate the formulation of strategies and action plans towards age-friendly city, a concise set of age-friendly city indicators needs to be developed: a set of indicators that has high objectivity but agrees well with subjective views of local older adults, that could be easily understood, and is easy to implement.This study piloted the adoption of the core indicators set proposed in "Measuring the age friendliness of cities: a guide to using core indicators" (World Health Organization, 2015) in an old urban district in Hong Kong. This study focused on factors related to mobility: walking environment, public transport, and accessible public buildings and spaces. Objective assessments have shown generally high level of performance in these physical environment attributes; the subjective ratings by local older adults were found to have medium relationship to the respective objective indicators. However, the relationship is weak in the subdomains of "neighbourhood walkability" and "accessible public spaces and buildings". It was found that the set of indicators is concise, easy to understand, and easy to implement. Yet, some refinements are suggested, such as: (1) include "affordability of public transport" in the indicator set, and (2) incorporate "quality of access" on top of "having a mean of access" into the objective indicators under "neighbourhood walkability" and "accessible public spaces and buildings". The "input" resources and "output" facilities and services by the government and private sectors that have led to the age-friendly city "outcomes" reflected by the indicators are also introduced.},

She connects the body, street, city, nation, and planet in one overarching theory of the modern, perpetually shifting world. Concepts of mobility are examined on a local level in the circulation of people, resources, and information, as well as on an urban scale, with questions of public transport and “the right to the city.” On the planetary level, she demands that we rethink the reality where tourists and other elites are able to roam freely, while migrants and those most in need are abandoned and imprisoned at the borders.Mobility Justice is a new way to understand the deep flows of inequality and uneven accessibility in a world in which the mobility commons have been enclosed.

  abstract = {Background: Evidence is mounting to suggest a causal relationship between the built environment and people’s physical activity behaviours, particularly active transport. The evidence base has been hindered to date by restricted consideration of cost and economic factors associated with built environment interventions, investigation of socioeconomic or ethnic differences in intervention effects, and an inability to isolate the effect of the built environment from other intervention types. The aims of this systematic review were to identify which environmental interventions increase physical activity in residents at the local level, and to build on the evidence base by considering intervention cost, and the differential effects of interventions by ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Methods: A systematic database search was conducted in June 2015. Articles were eligible if they reported a quantitative empirical study (natural experiment or a prospective, retrospective, experimental, or longitudinal research) investigating the relationship between objectively measured built environment feature(s) and physical activity and/or travel behaviours in children or adults. Quality assessment was conducted and data on intervention cost and whether the effect of the built environment differed by ethnicity or socioeconomic status were extracted. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included in the review. Findings showed a positive effect of walkability components, provision of quality parks and playgrounds, and installation of or improvements in active transport infrastructure on active transport, physical activity, and visits or use of settings. There was some indication that infrastructure improvements may predominantly benefit socioeconomically advantaged groups. Studies were commonly limited by selection bias and insufficient controlling for confounders. Heterogeneity in study design and reporting limited comparability across studies or any clear conclusions to be made regarding intervention cost. Conclusions: Improving neighbourhood walkability, quality of parks and playgrounds, and providing adequate active transport infrastructure is likely to generate positive impacts on activity in children and adults. The possibility that the benefits of infrastructure improvements may be inequitably distributed requires further investigation. Opportunities to improve the quality of evidence exist, including strategies to improve response rates and representativeness, use of valid and reliable measurement tools, cost-benefit analyses, and adequate controlling for confounders.},

  abstract = {With recent rapid urbanization, sustainable development is required to prevent health risks associated with adverse environmental exposures from the unsustainable development of cities. Ambient air pollution is the greatest environmental risk factor for human health and is responsible for considerable levels of mortality worldwide. Burden of disease assessment (BoD) of air pollution in and across cities, and how these estimates vary according to socioeconomic status and exposure to road traffic, can help city planners and health practitioners to mitigate adverse exposures and promote public health. In this study, we quantified the health impacts of air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) at the census tract level in Houston, Texas, employing a standard BoD assessment framework to estimate the premature deaths (adults 30 to 78 years old) attributable to PM2.5 and NO2. We found that 631 (95\% CI: 366-809) premature deaths were attributable to PM2.5 in Houston, and 159 (95\% CI: 0-609) were attributable to NO2, in 2010. Complying with the World Health Organization air quality guidelines (annual mean: 10 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5) and the US National Ambient Air Quality standard (annual mean: 12 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5) could save 82 (95\% CI: 42-95) and 8 (95\% CI: 6-10) lives in Houston, respectively. PM2.5 was responsible for 7.3\% of all-cause premature deaths in Houston, in 2010, which is higher than the death rate associated with diabetes mellites, Alzheimer's disease, or motor vehicle crashes in the US. Households with lower income had a higher risk of adverse exposure and attributable premature deaths. We also showed a positive relationship between health impacts attributable to air pollution and road traffic passing through census tracts, which was more prominent for NO2.},

A fundamental way of improving the travelling conditions for people with reduced mobility is to adapt elements of the transportation system, including interchanges, to their needs. This article covers the niche subject of adapting interchanges to the needs of people with reduced mobility. It contains the results of research assessing selected interchanges in Kraków (Poland) for the needs of that user group. The four variants of interchanges were assessed with one of the Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) methods – the Compensation-Conjunctive method, which allowed to obtain the final rankings of the interchanges. The adaptation of the Assessment Method of Public Transport Interchanges (AMPTI), expanded with aspects resulting from a review of literature and the authors’ experience ensured a broad range of assessment criteria that comprehensively refer to the interchange planning. The unique nature of the research is the fact that opinions of people with reduced mobility were taken into account and the results proved that the most important aspects of interchanges are spatial compactness and solutions dedicated strictly for persons with reduced mobility. The other major aspects are quality of stop infrastructure and information.},

Despite the pace at which South Australia is ageing, there is still no overall plan for providing for transport needs of older people.  The overall objective of the study was to conduct an audit of older people's transport needs and requirements, taking account of future demographic changes.  The study used data collected in the primary survey conducted during March 2007.  The survey sought travel details from people aged 65 and above for a particular day (4am to 4 am next day).  This survey has also sought the opinions of older people in Adelaide with regard to their mobility and especially public transport needs.  This  paper presents initial results from a survey travel patterns of the elderly in Adelaide metropolitan area.  The present study has highlighted several factors dealing with public transport (especially buses) for the elderly.  Among them, steep steps on the older buses, drivers not waiting for them to be seated before they drive off, poor frequency of buses during off  peak hours and weekends, and not having designated and priority seating in the buses were ranked high in their list of suggestions.

  abstract = {The accessibility of transit stops (ATS) is a critical index for the evaluation of transit service, focusing on the first/last mile portions of transit trips. It is significantly affected by feeder modes, such as walking and cycling. Comparison of the application of different modes has been addressed in previous research, thus there is mostly only one feeder mode considered in this case study. This study has proposed a model for ATS with multiple feeder modes (ATSMFM), capable of integrating multiple feeder modes and considering the heterogeneity of travellers from the perspective of city managers. It is a bi-level model, combining cumulative and utility-based approaches. The final form of ATSMFM is developed referring to the cumulative approach, while the determination of the catchment area is utility-based. A numerical experiment has been conducted to demonstrate the necessity and applicability of ATSMFM. The results show that the ATS with a single feeder mode, such as cycling or walking, underestimates the catchment area of nearly one-third or two-thirds of travellers. As for ATSMFM, this proposed approach can automatically select the feeder mode from alternatives according to traveller attributes, thus removing the limitation of a single feeder mode, and is suitable for calculating ATS in the complex environment with multiple feeder modes. Besides, the ATSMFM model can support city managers with different emphases in transit planning via flexibly setting the threshold.},

Given that transportation has become a leading component of urban greenhouse gas emissions, combining sustainable performance assessment with transportation emissions is crucial to urban sustainability. In this study, pointed at the unbalance between urban development and transportation accessibility among urban central activities zones, a metric named potential traffic attraction is proposed based on improved gravitational model to measure urban sustainable performance. Meanwhile, the correlation between the traffic attraction and the high-emission traffic is generated via GPS trajectories, which could ensure the credibility of high-emission travel mode for the correlation model. Based on the obtained urban sustainable performance, the status of the central activities zones development in Tokyo(Japan) was analyzed, finally, several corresponding strategies in different sustainable development status were proposed. Our study demonstrated that the integration of both urban development and transportation owns tremendous capabilities for reducing vehicle emissions, and it could provide specific guidelines for urban planning and transportation policies on urban sustainable development.

In the case of the Lyon Metropolitan Area (France), we simulate a cordon pricing and evaluate its impacts on inequalities. We adopt a comparison-based approach to reduce the bias resulting from the spatial division. In agreement with the literature, we show that different inequality indicators produce contrasted and sometimes contradictory results, both at the scale of zones or metropolitan level. Results from Theil and Atkinson indicators point out introducing a toll can reduce inequalities in the most peripheral zones. Although we observe an accessibility improvement, particularly for central zones, the first ring (adjacent to the toll zone) is the most adversely affected by toll.}

The idea that the accessibility of a place can be measured by the variety and quantity of opportunities available at the destination has led to the creation and adaptation of various indicators. The new mode of transport known as ride hailing (RH) has grown in recent years throughout the world, making it necessary to evaluate its impact on modern society, mainly its interaction with other modes. Therefore, this article presents a method to calculate the accessibility of formal jobs generated by public transportation (PT) and RH, to compare the results. For this purpose, we made adaptations to two indicators commonly used in the literature: the Gini index combined with the Lorenz curve; and the location quotient (LQ). The integrated structure is demonstrated in the context of a case study conducted in four districts of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. By applying the proposed method, we found that in regions with high commercial concentration and number of jobs, with the fares charged in the city, the accessibility to formal jobs generated by RH is greater than that associated with PT when more than two passengers travel together. This information on the competition or complementarity of the two modes can be useful to make decisions for regulation of the transport sector in general, and ride hailing in particular.},

In existing scientific papers, the authors have dealt with the impact of the remoteness of settlements and their accessibility from the city center. The main aims of this paper are to define and quantify the criteria that have the greatest influence on traffic accessibility in suburban areas, that is, to develop a model of traffic accessibility. This model refers to traffic accessibility in suburban areas, where an urban public transport system is operational and represents a qualitative approach to research. Research has shown that factors such as a network of public transport (PT) lines, a network of accessible roads in a settlement, travel time, and timetables are of great importance in the description and generation of a new model. This model was tested in 23 suburban districts with regard to the needed walking time. The Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) method, one of the most popular methods for multi-criteria decision making, was used. Based on the results presented in this paper, it is expected that the application of this model will enable development and sustainability in suburban areas, as well as greater social equality and involvement of dwellers (especially the younger generation) in social activities, in view of achieving a better quality of life.}

This is done by making a threefold analysis, which combines the overall improvement in the level of accessibility, territorial cohesion, and spatial spillovers. Moreover, we use different spatial dimensions (namely national and international) and different distance decay parameters to estimate both the short trips (e.g. commuting) and the long trips (e.g. business trips or tourism). The results are presented at a very detailed spatial scale (i.e. municipalities - LAU-2 units).The paper provides empirical evidence of improvement in accessibility, changes in the degree of territorial cohesion, and spatial spillovers resulting from the recent completion of two sections of motorway in Poland. The selected case studies differ according to their location (i.e. national and European, peripheral vs. central location), population density, and the settlement structure around the investment.The validity of the proposed multidimensional approach to the evaluation of road investments is verified as the combination of different accessibility dimensions and leads to results which differ respecting efficiency, equity and spillover effects. This paper provides arguments to strengthen the need for the tailor-made parameters of potential accessibility indicator and spatial dimension of analysis. They should be adjusted to the main aim of the particular evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, recent findings reveal widespread barriers in the Swedish public transport system and large variations between different parts of the country. This paper draws on empirical material consisting of complaints regarding accessibility left by travellers in Stockholm to a local transit company and aims to provide an overview of the character of complaints and to identify common themes through a qualitative content analysis. The results show that the most commonly reported challenge relates to boarding or getting off the vehicles, where the drivers are mostly described as the underlying reason for those difficulties. The narratives describe how some drivers misuse (or do not use) the accessibility equipment or show an abusive or attitudinal behaviour. The results support the body of literature on the meaning of continuous work with accessibility issues in public transport. Varying views on disability may have had a substantial impact on the development of our societies and on how the issues of accessibility in the public transport system have been prioritised or handled. Thus, this study highlights existing social barriers and variations in individual capacities as important factors that influence the experiences of public transport users. The study recommends an increased focus on educating drivers and staff about how to accommodate different groups of travellers. The study also recommends that transport providers consider drivers' working conditions (i.e., with the consideration of timetables and high time-pressure). Further research on how well accessibility adaptations in public transport actually work and how the users perceive them is necessary.},

  abstract = {Transport planning is gradually shifting targets towards modifying the pedestrian streetscapes that favor walking and enhance urban sustainability. We cannot be optimistic about walkability on condition that walkable streets are not evenly distributed within urban settings. Auditing the street walkability and associated social inequalities in developing countries should provide critical implications for transport planning. This paper identifies the most common indicators in existing indicator classification frameworks based on word frequency; and then establishes an indicator classification system (connectivity, accessibility, suitability, serviceability, and perceptibility) through expert panel evaluation for auditing street walkability in China. Using a case of Hangzhou metropolitan area, a set of 13 indicators are first selected by referring to the established indicator classification system and then aggregated into an integrated walkability index (IWI) through the catastrophe theory (CT) model after appropriate data treatment (standardization, normalization and correlation calculation). Camera signaling data are employed to validate the developed IWI. Results show that IWI is efficient to audit street walkability. IWI presents great heterogeneity at segment level. In general, higher walkability is observed in streets across the central and western areas. Walkability profiles of the segments are further produced by the clustering approach and the categorized groups can inform more targeted planning options. Spatial regression is finally utilized to quantify the associations between community socio-demographics and neighborhood IWI at two levels. We discover that lower neighborhood walkability would be observed in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. These results suggest that significant social inequalities in street walkability should exist across the communities within Hangzhou metropolitan area. The developed IWI not only brings a standardized measurement of street walkability in the field of transport planning, but also paves the way for addressing the social inequalities in street design across various jurisdictions.}

Respondents were asked questions about their residential location, their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and their walking activities. This study then used geographic information systems to measure objective indicators of built environment variables within 500-meter buffer areas based on the home addresses of the respondents. Then, this study constructed multilevel regression models with walking activity as the dependent variable.

  abstract = {The general transit feed specification is becoming a popular data format for the publication of public transport schedules, making possible the collection of a nation-wide public transport schedule dataset, which enables monitoring of transit supply at an up-to-date and more precise level across a country than previously possible. In this paper, we use general transit feed specification data to measure local-scale public transport availability across England based on service frequency and spatial proximity to public transport stops/stations. Moreover, to demonstrate the usefulness of public transport availability measures, we examine inequalities of public transport provision and identify areas at risk of transport poverty across England. Furthermore, we estimate population (number of households) who are likely to suffer from transport poverty, accounting for public transport availability, time-based job accessibility by public transport or walking, household income and car ownership levels. Based on the criteria, we have used to identify public transport risk, we find that investment in the development of public transport services should prioritise West Midlands, East of England, South East and South West as those regions have more households who are likely to suffer from transport poverty. This paper contributes by (1) defining more comprehensive transit availability measures than existing measures at a variety of geography levels and (2) integrating fours aspects (i.e. public transport availability, job accessibility by public transport or walking, household income and car availability) to analyse transport poverty comprehensively.}

We examined socio-demographic and geographical determinants of RTA mortality in Switzerland by linking 2000 census data to RTA mortality records 2000-2005 (ICD-10 codes V00-V99). Data from 5.5 million residents aged 18-94 years, 1744 study areas. and 1620 RTA deaths were analyzed, including 978 deaths (60.4\%) in motor vehicle occupants, 254 (15.7\%) in motorcyclists, 107 (6.6\%) in cyclists, and 259 (16.0\%) in pedestrians. Weibull survival models and Bayesian methods were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR), and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) across study areas.Adjusted HR comparing women with men ranged from 0.04 (95\% CI 0.02-0.07) in motorcyclists to 0.43 (95\% CI 0.32-0.56) in pedestrians. There was a u-shaped relationship with age in motor vehicle occupants and motorcyclists. In cyclists and pedestrians, mortality increased after age 55 years. Mortality was higher in individuals with primary education (HR 1.53; 95\% CI 1.29-1.81), and higher in single (HR 1.24; 95\% CI 1.05-1.46), widowed (HR 1.31; 95\% CI 1.05-1.65) and divorced individuals (HR 1.62; 95\% CI 1.33-1.97), compared to persons with tertiary education or married persons. The association with education was particularly strong for pedestrians (HR 1.87; 95\% CI 1.20-2.91). RTA mortality increased with decreasing population density of study areas for motor vehicle occupants (test for trend p {$<$} 0.0001) and motorcyclists (p = 0.0021) but not for cyclists (p = 0.39) or pedestrians (p = 0.29). SMR standardized for socio-demographic and geographical variables ranged from 82 to 190.Prevention efforts should aim to reduce inequities across socio-demographic and educational groups, and across geographical areas, with interventions targeted at high-risk groups and areas, and different traffic users, including pedestrians.

The participant was asked on a platform in the Pedestrian Accessibility and Movement Environment Laboratory (PAMELA 0 facility, which simulated street environments and various hazards under four different lighting conditions. The hazards included obstacles, steps and combinations of vertical and horizontal gaps. In low lighting conditions, the participant fixated “hazard” objects more than “orientation” objects. For ascending steps, the duration of fixations corresponded to the step height, whereas for descending steps, the duration did not largely change according to the step height and it was less than that for ascending steps. These results suggest that pedestrians pay attention to hazards according not to actual danger but to the visual perception. Regardless of actual danger, visually obscure objects do not attract the attention of pedestrians. Further investigation should be made on pedestrians’ perception of hazard and orientation objects as well as the luminance level below which pedestrians need more time/duration of fixation to perceive hazards (threshold).}

Our spatial database includes street topography, physical impedances, formal crossings, and designated access points in assessing the network distance of all private residential buildings to public open space in Hong Kong. Pedestrian movement of uneven speed on walkways of varying gradients is assessed. The study concludes that, compared with our method, conventional buffer analysis and network distance analysis over-estimate the walking accessibility of private housing to neighbourhood open space in Hong Kong by about 2-8\%. Despite Hong Kong's compact built environment, about 15\% of the total number of residential blocks cannot reach a neighbourhood open space within 5 minutes of walking (equivalent to the local planning standard of 400 metres of walking on a flat terrain). These open space-deficient neighbourhoods comprise mostly the affluent or middle-class households in gated housing estates and in low-rise housing, but also some neighbourhoods of underprivileged families in old urban tenement buildings. Our assessment reveals the spatial bias of land use planning policy leading to these blackspots of open space shortfall in the territory. It requires urban planners to pay attention to the geographical barriers of a pedestrian network in redressing the inequitable distribution and achieving a pedestrian-friendly 3D city.}

We argue that welfare spending contributes to sustaining peace because the provision of social services reduces grievances by offsetting the effects of poverty and inequality in society. Welfare spending serves as an indication of the commitment of the government to social services and reflects its priorities and dedication to citizens. By enacting welfare policies that improve the living standards of citizens, governments can co-opt the political opposition and decrease the incentives for organizing a rebellion. Utilizing time-series, cross-national data for the 1975?2005 period, the results indicate that as the level of the government investment in welfare policies (i.e. education, health, and social security) increases, the likelihood of civil conflict onset declines significantly, controlling for several other covariates of internal conflict. Additional data analysis shows that general public spending and military expenditures are unlikely to increase or decrease the probability of civil unrest. Overall, these findings suggest that certain types of public spending, such as welfare spending, might have a strong pacifying effect on civil conflict, and therefore the state?s welfare efforts are vital for the maintenance of peace.},

Urban transport planning systems can fuel healthy cities, yet research examining the interface between policies and needs in Africa remains scarce. A mixed-methods approach was used to assess the alignment between urban transport policies and self-reported citizens' needs in Port Louis city (Mauritius). Logistic regression models were run to detect associations between needs and demographic indicators (age, gender, income). Three policy measures were assessed: light metro rail system, bus modernization scheme and road decongestion program. Six citizen needs and six mode of transit preferences were extracted from 1523 surveys (N). Citizens reported the need for improving sidewalks (80\%), public spaces (77\%), green spaces (67\%), pedestrianizing strategic areas (66\%), centralizing street-vendors at bus stations (57\%) and regulating private vehicles entry in town (40\%). The policies addressed 3 out of 6 needs, of which all were more likely to be expressed by poorer population groups. The policies did not respond to citizen needs for active modes of travel. They did not address health and social co benefits of transport. Rather they emphasized an economic agenda focused on transport infrastructure as opposed to policy reforms in line with public needs that much more strongly highlight the integration of urban transport planning in social life. Citizen-centred approaches provide a unique opportunity to reform urban transport planning policies towards more healthy and equitable cities in developing countries.}

The aim of this study is to examine associations between the neighborhood social environment and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA)(1) and walking among women, and whether these associations are mediated by perceived personal safety.Methods. Women (n = 3784) living in disadvantaged urban and rural neighborhoods within Victoria, Australia completed a self-administered survey on five social environment variables (neighborhood crime, neighborhood violence, seeing others walking and exercising in the neighborhood, social trust/cohesion), perceived personal safety, and their physical activity in 2007/8. Linear regression analyses examined associations between social environment variables and LTPA and walking. Potential mediating pathways were assessed using the product-of-coefficients test. Moderated mediation by urban/rural residence was examined.Results. Each social environment variable was positively associated with engaging in at least 150 min/week of LTPA (OR = 1.16 to 1.56). Only two social environment variables, seeing others walking (OR = 1.45) and exercising (OR = 1.31), were associated with {$>$}= 150 min/week of walking. Perceived personal safety mediated all associations. Stronger mediation was found in urban areas for crime, violence and social trust/cohesion.Conclusion. The neighborhood social environment is an important influence on physical activity among women living in disadvantaged areas. Feelings of personal safety should not be included in composite or aggregate scores relating to the social environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.},

To aid and monitor this process the UK Department for Transport (DfT) has produced a set of national accessibility indicators.  In addition, in their Guidance on Accessibility Planning in Local Transport Plans, DfT recommends that local authorities produce their own sets of accessibility indicators and targets.  An earlier examination of social exclusion literature and Great Britain National Travel Survey data showed that the national accessibility indicators were of limited relevance to some social excluded groups such as lone parents.  Lone parents in particular experience problems coordinating work time with childcare and education time, which creates complex transport needs.  These are not reflected in simple travel-time measures of accessibility such as those used by DfT.  This paper reports on research undertaken as part of an EPSRC funded project - AUNT-SUE (Accessibility and User Needs in Transport for Sustainable Urban Environments) - to develop an appropriate set of accessibility benchmarks for lone parents.  The journey characteristics of lone parents and their families are considered through an analysis of National Travel Survey and other data.  The paper then proposes some provisional benchmarks based on this analysis and the results of a number of interviews with lone parents.}

SDG Target 11.2 specifically mentions urban transport. Localizing SDG Target 11.2 involves city governments ensuring a public transport (PT) system that has at least two dimensions of accessibility: physical and economic. This translates to ensuring barrier-free physical access to the PT system, as well as affordable fares for using the PT system. This study presents a process for operationalizing the SDG Target 11.2 indicator for small cities in India. The study focuses on addressing physical access to quality public transport system. Presently, the commuters in these cities are dependent on intermediate PT (IPT) systems to meet their mobility needs.Small cities lack a detailed database for planning PT systems. Master plans are generally prepared by planning authorities to guide the future development of cities; however, the master plan documents lack discussion and vision for future mobility, as required by SDG Target 11.2. This study concludes that the current indicator for SDG Target 11.2 requires modification to ensure SDG-compliant PT systems in small cities. An integrated IPT and PT system is required to improve access to high-quality PT systems, in line with SDG Target 11.2.}

To address this goal, public transport plays a fundamental role and, therefore, it is key for developing a sustainable and equitable city.This paper proposes a methodology to analyze access to opportunities through public transport incorporating the user's valuation of attributes that impact the level of service on his/her trip and the competitiveness for urban opportunities. Using data from Santiago, Chile, we applied the proposed methodology to analyze accessibility to higher-quality public primary schools. We compare total travel time (TTT) with a proposed measure of total generalized travel time (TGTT) using simple potential and competitive accessibility indicators, accounting for the subjective valuation of walking time, travel time, waiting time, comfort and transfers, and translating them into in-vehicle time units.We find that the inclusion of competition has a more substantial impact than including the subjective valuation of the level of service in the accessibility to educational opportunities. Using competitive measures with TGTT, we found that around 20\% of the zones in Santiago have at least a 50\% deficit of higher-quality public education, and 71\% of them are in peripheral areas. Furthermore, these zones, where medium and low-income population usually lives, can experience, on average, 1-2 transfers, 4-5 passengers per square meter, and 15-min waiting. We conclude that the proposed methodology provides a more comprehensive way to understand accessibility by incorporating the traveling experience, allowing to determine how and where to intervene to effectively improve accessibility, with a focus on urban equity.}

This approach ignores other accessibility barriers, such as the quality of the urban environment of these walks. The aim of this research is to analyze both accessibility to public transport stops and the quality of the urban walking environment, exploring fairness issues across the city in terms of these two dimensions. The proposed methodology considers the definition of two indicators: walking accessibility to public transport stops and quality of the walking environment, considering different attributes and dimensions. These indicators are later used to develop a fairness analysis at the local and metropolitan level, using Lorenz curves, Gini coefficient, and Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) poverty measures. A diagnosis based on these indicators for Santiago de Chile allows us to suggest public policy priorities to improve accessibility to public transport and promote modal shift. The results show that 12 out of 34 municipalities in Santiago are deprived of one or both dimensions, not managing to achieve minimum fairness standards. Moreover, since a correlation between low income and poor access and urban space quality is detected, urban fairness across the city would benefit from centralized urban policies not depending on the budget of each administrative division.}

FHWA recognized that because AASHTO's design recommendations are based on the characteristics of bicyclists, they may not adequately accommodate other users. Further, some emerging user groups have been petitioning state legislatures throughout the United States for legal access to public roads. Consequently, determining the operating and safety characteristics of these emerging users has become important for the safe accommodation of all nonmotorized users of the transportation system. Some of the findings of research undertaken to examine the characteristics of bicyclists and emerging users are reported. Three "Ride for Science" data collection events were conducted to obtain the physical dimensions, turning capabilities, acceleration, speed, lateral operating space, and stopping sight distance of trail users. Results show that there is great diversity in the operating characteristics of various road and trail user types. AASHTO's design bicycle length of 6 ft and width of 30 in. were adequate for the majority of observed users. However, bicycle trailers and recumbent bicycles exceeded the design length. Power wheelchairs exceeded the design width. The recommended two-way trail width of 10 ft gave most users traveling single file in opposite directions enough room to pass each other, though some only barely. Results of this research will be valuable in either updating or developing new design guidelines for road and shared use path design to better accommodate emerging user groups.},

After 35 years, little has been done and the reasons behind this delay are mainly political, as the failure to implement congestion metering in Cambridge at the beginning of the 1990s shows. The subject has taken on a new urgency now that the U.K. government has announced its intention to authorize local councils to introduce road charges, Road pricing has a strong theoretical basis, but congestion costs must be quantified before it can be implemented. For that purpose, a simulation model is used. The social costs of congestion are measured by the deadweight loss and calculated from the difference between the marginal social costs and the price actually paid by trip makers. An exercise was done for two similar towns, Cambridge and York, and potential road charges differing by only 8 percent on average were obtained. This seems to strengthen the idea that finding road charges in a few cases, each one characteristic of a larger set of towns, would allow the provision of guidelines to local councils. In that way, fair road prices could be established across the U.K. The use of revenues from public-accepted road charges is also discussed.},

However, some policies and technologies are permitting regions in Latin America and Asia to begin to change.

  abstract = {Introduction: Inaccessibility due to terrain and lack of transport leaves mothers travelling for long hours before reaching a facility to deliver a child. In the present article we analyzed the issue of spatial inaccessibility and inequity of maternal health services in the Indian Sundarbans where complex topography and repeated climatic adversities make access to health services very difficult.Methods: We based the article on the health-GIS study conducted in the Patharpratima Block of the Sundarbans in the year 2012. The region has 87 villages that are inhabited, of which 54 villages are in the deltaic (river locked) region and 33 villages are located in the non-deltaic region of the block. We mapped all public and private maternal health facilities and road and water transport network. For measuring inaccessibility, we use the enhanced two-step floating catchment area method (E2SFCA). For assessing inequity in spatial access, we developed an area-based socioeconomic score and constructed a concentration curve to depict inequity. We used ARC GIS 10.3.1 and Stata 11 software for our analysis.Results: The maternal health facilities are primarily located in the non-deltaic region of the block. On an average it takes 33.81 min to reach the closest maternal health facility. Fifty-two villages out of eighty seven villages have access scores less than the score calculated using Indian Primary Health Standards. Ten villages cannot access any maternal health facility; twenty-six villages have access scores of less than one doctor for 1000 pregnant women; fifty-six villages have access scores less than the block average of 3.54. The access scores are lower among villages in the deltaic region compared to the non-deltaic region. The concentration curve is below the line of equality showing that access scores were lower among villages that were socio-economically disadvantaged.Conclusions: Maternal health facilities are not equitably accessible to the populations that are disadvantaged and living in the remote pockets of the study region. Provision of a referral transport system along with a resilient infrastructure of roads is critical to improve access in these islands.}

While there have been theoretical suggestions to base transportation planning methods on the philosophical principle of ”sufficientarianism” (whereby everyone is entitled to a minimum level of a good or service), the proposed approaches have not yet been developed enough to be usable for policy decision-making. In this paper the authors aim to bridge this gap by operationalizing in a case study an indicator of equity based on the theoretical work of Martens (2017) which argues for sufficientarianism. The presented formalised methodology can identify and quantify equity issues in transportation, is flexible to different contexts, and is a transparent way to assess equity in transportation. The case study shows that data availability is an important constraint and that careful attention must be paid to various assumptions and choices made.}

While Martens makes several telling points, we explore how debates in the justice literature apply to the case of transportation, and may question aspects of transportation justice theory. In particular we discuss the issues of (1) the paternalistic treatment of people below the accessibility poverty line, and (2) the production and planning of transportation services. Two cases are used to inform this theoretical discussion, on the one hand, the Transportation Justice movement in California, and on the other, the “basic accessibility” debate in Flanders (Belgium).},

The literature on ethical preferences of people, at least as far as related to the distribution of effects of candidate transport policy options, is in its infancy. Interesting topics for future research include distributions in the area of safety, the environment, mobility, changes in distributions over time, preferences of potential users with respect to equity analyses, and the integration of equity analyses in wider evaluation frameworks.},

Accessibility changes are included in such analyses indirectly, via a utilitarian perspective. But accessibility is broader than is assumed by this perspective and also incorporates equity and related distribution effects as well as social exclusion. This paper aims to give an overview of the relevance of distribution effects and equity, and social exclusion for accessibility, based on the literature. The most important conclusions of our paper is that the two subjects are poorly addressed in transport appraisal in general, and in CBA in particular. Additional ethical theories could add value to the utilitarian perspective, egalitarian theories being a major competitor. Equity analysis is however complex because there are several types of equity, various ways to categorize people for equity analysis, numerous impacts to consider, and various ways of measuring these impacts. And such analysis requires normative judgements, in addition to simply presenting distribution effects. Several options are available to express distribution effects. Important choices to be made if such effects need to be reported relate to the unit of comparison (e. g. the household versus the individual), the indicator to be used, and the value of each unit to be compared (e. g. accessibility) for all units of comparison (e. g. households). We also conclude that CBA is not suitable for evaluating social exclusion policies. Based on this overview we propose an agenda for potential future research in the area of ethics and accessibility.}

  abstract = {Urban mobility is a key issue in sustainable urban development policies. However, in the last few decades, the rise of urban traffic has aggravated environmental quality, spatial fragmentation, and social cohesion in metropolitan areas. Meeting commuter’s needs should not be contrary to improving the quality of the environment. Public politics based on an integrated spatial planning of urban mobility and the urban fabric, following environmental principles, would contribute to make an accessible system of public spaces. The main goal of this research is to assess how a mass transport network could become the backbone of a metropolitan public space system. Integrated planning of public transport and open space system could contribute to improve indicators related to urban mobility, environmental quality and social inclusion, in unstructured environments and socially vulnerable communities. This scientific–analytic research is focused on three variables: urban mobility, urban morphology and social inclusion, and their quantitative and qualitative indicators (traffic flows, land-use patterns, air pollution, socio-economic status, public space area per capita, etc.). These indicators are tested in Metro Line 2 of Lima, currently under construction. Lima Metropolitana is one of the largest Latin-American conurbations with a population of just over 9.5 million and 22 million commuters daily. Moreover, traffic congestion is considered by residents as the city’s second most important problem, despite which 75\% of trips take place daily on public transport. An urban model based on unbalanced urban densities and no mixed land-use patterns, and informal transport services undermines the creation of a metropolitan open space system. An integrated spatial planning based on mobility and public space improving the future exchange nodes of Metro Line from a spatial and social point of view could contribute to reducing the impacts of urban flows, such as spatial fragmentation, social inequality and environmental pollution.},

Discussing this growing but scattered literature, the paper embraces the emerging direction that understands accessibility as the capability that transport planning and policy should consider. Further refining this understanding, the paper proposes a twofold evaluative approach combining a top-down and a bottom-up component to capture the myriad of conversion factors shaping people’s accessibility-as-capability and functioning. By systematically adopting the Capabilities Approach, transport planning and mobility policies will be directed to enhancing each person’s freedom to pursue the life they have reason to value in contemporary societies.},

  abstract = {A growing concern for mobility-related social inclusion and equity is evident from both academic research and planning best practices. Scholarly research promotes accessibility as the main aim of transport planning, assuming it as the evaluative approach that better conveys how mobility contributes to individuals’ well-being and participation in social life. Accessibility can be crucial to address the socio-spatial inequalities that characterise manifold settings across the world. Amongst them, Latin American countries have been keen in tackling such imbalances through mobilityrelated interventions, as the renowned cases of Curitiba, Medellin and Bogotá show. The widespread interest in mobility as both a cause and effect of social disparities has generated an increasing stream of work that examines Latin American settings through the lenses of accessibility. This paper aims at critically reviewing the growing scholarly works that, providing accessibility-based evaluations, has examined issues of transport and equity in Latin America. Proposing a novel conceptual framework that considers the underlying ethical stance, components of accessibility and implications for planning and policy, this work examines what approaches, features and indicators are present in the current literature, as well as what settings have been taken into consideration by scholarly research. Moreover, the review has an explicit operational interest, to define what indicators are relevant or missing to assess accessibility in the light of social concerns, as well as to consider the current and potential implications that such research findings have on transport planning and policy. The review highlights how a growing but still limited body of work has examined transport and equity in Latin America, suggesting academic, technical and operational avenues to enhance theoretical and practical approaches to the issue.},

We compare alternative accessibility policies based on the expansion of the Metro infrastructure network or on reduced public transport fares, considering the interaction between the spatial availability and the affordability of public transport. Results show that subsidized fares for public transport services are more beneficial to expand the accessibility of older people, especially those with lower incomes, while the expansion of the Metro network benefits mainly middle- and high-income older people. The proposed analysis is a first step towards a more detailed, place-based reading of mobility-related inequalities, aimed at assessing alternative policy measures.},

These advances are meant to remove physical barriers to entering the bus, but new conflicts have arisen particularly over the physical space aboard. We aimed to research the barriers faced by wheelchair users in public transport using a mixed methods approach to establish the breadth of issues faced by wheelchair users. To this end we quantified the push-force used alight a bus and a study to understand the coping mechanisms used by people to propel up a ramp. This quantitative approach found push forces which resulted in a load of 2 to 3 times body weight being transferred through people's shoulders, forces which can be directly linked to shoulder injury. This could disable the user further, preventing them from being able to push their wheelchair. Alongside the quantitative study, we conducted qualitative research comprising of a number of in-depth interviews with wheelchair users about the barriers they face in public transport. Our main claim, highlighted through this interdisciplinary collaboration, is that proposed 'solutions' to accessibility, such as ramps, often generate problems of their own. These barriers can affect the life of wheelchair users, impacting on their confidence and causing social isolation. These can be long-term in nature or immediate.}

However, it is not well understood how these impacts differ between different socioeconomic groups (e.g. economically advantaged and disadvantaged people) and how neighborhood planning affects the difference. Using data of public housing and private housing residents in Hong Kong in 2010, this study applies the propensity score matching approach to identify differences in activity-travel behavior under different built environment settings for private and public housing residents respectively. We find that density, accessibility and self-containment collectively affect private housing residents' auto ownership, travel time, trip frequency, and entertainment time spent at home, but have few influences on public housing dwellers. The different built environment effects are partly because the planning standards and guidelines in Hong Kong stipulate the provision of daily facilities and services such as grocery shops/supermarket, primary school and transit in proximity to public housing development. Thus, although economically disadvantaged people have limited transportation resources, neighborhood planning can adequately meet their daily needs even if they are placed in suburban areas.

The objective of using equity is to quantify and evaluate how bus service is distributed among population and employment locations, with the goal of significantly enhancing policy analysis. The essence of the measure is quantifying service supply satisfaction to traffic demand. In the demand portion, K-Means Clustering Analysis is conducted to determine the degree of traffic demand, while the level of bus spatial coverage is modified by street connectivity and practical bus-serviced area, in terms of supply. The method is then applied to the planned bus skeleton network of Changxing Center Area. The results of the case study suggest the demand supply inconformity (DSI) is effective and could be a useful reference to help decision-makers analyze and optimize the distribution of bus service in a more equitable manner.}

It applies and improves on two widely used accessibility models-the gravity model and the two-step floating catchment area model-in measuring spatial accessibility by Mainland Chinese immigrants in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area. Empirical data on physician-seeking behaviors are collected through two rounds of questionnaire surveys. Attention is focused on journey to physician location and utilization of linguistically matched family physicians. Based on the survey data, a two-zone accessibility model is developed by relaxing the travel threshold and distance impedance parameters that are traditionally treated as a constant in the accessibility models. General linear models are used to identify relationships among spatial accessibility, geography, and socioeconomic characteristics of Mainland Chinese immigrants. The results suggest a spatial mismatch in the supply of and demand for culturally sensitive care, and residential location is the primary factor that determines spatial accessibility to family physicians. The article yields important policy implications.}

Park green spaces (PGSs) are essential neighborhood land use assets, as they are beneficial for population health and thus should mitigate SES-related health inequalities. This paper aims to elaborate the knowledge on the complex interrelationships among PGSs, health outcomes and social inequalities through developing a set of mixed indicators in an integrated manner. The data are obtained at the community level (N=8117) for three health outcomes (cardiopathy, chronic pneumonia and hypertension) and five SES variables. The PGS characteristics are described from three dimensions (coverage, quality and accessibility) at two geographical levels (15-minute walking distance (15 WD) neighborhoods and 30-minute walking distance (30 WD) neighborhoods). Spatial regressions reveal the following: 1) socioeconomically disadvantaged communities enjoy fewer PGSs and limited access to parks of high quality; 2) socioeconomically disadvantaged communities present higher incidences of diseases; and 3) PGS coverage within 30 WD neighborhoods and PGS accessibility within 15 WD neighborhoods are related to health outcomes. Structural equation modeling further confirms that PGSs, especially those of higher quality, could mitigate SES-related health inequalities. The findings of this study highlight the necessity of improving the PGS quality within walking distance of socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. We thus argue that land use policy makers should collaborate with social researchers and health professionals; and through health impact assessment, they can translate the professional knowledge into land use planning and consider health promotion into land use policies.}

Little attention has been paid to evaluate its potential impacts on ground transportation accessibility. To answer this question, we adopted a door-to-door approach to calculate two indicators: the weighted average travel time and daily accessibility. The results show that the HSR network follows the same spatial patterns of population size and regional development, thus preferentially serving eastern China. The two accessibility indicators suggest that the large-scale construction of HSR network by 2030 will substantially improve accessibility and alter the spatial disparities of accessibility. On average, accessibility of all cities will increase by 61.7\%. Geographically, cities with higher accessibility are located in the quadrilateral area of 'Wuhan-Zhengzhou-Jinan-Nanjing' on the southeastern section of the 'Hu Line.' While the least accessible cities are distributed in peripheral areas. Although the HSR development can benefit accessibility throughout the country, the disparities of accessibility would widen slightly among regions, provinces and cities.}

  abstract = {In China, with the rapid development of urbanisation, the contradiction between supply and demand has become increasingly severe, particularly in large and medium-sized cities. Improving public transport equity can help to reduce the social exclusion of lower-income and socially vulnerable groups in relation to the urban transport system, and guarantee that public transport systems are given priority in terms of development. Using the concept of transport-related social equity, this study aims to explore the effects of public transport equity in relation to the quality of public transport, public participation, and public transport-related policy using Shenyang as a case study. Data are analysed using Structural Equation Model (SEM). The findings show that the three latent variables of accessibility, affordability, and social impacts can be seen as representing the main characteristics of public transport equity; while improvements in public transport quality, public participation, and public transport-related polices play a significant role in reducing public transport inequity. Moreover, the findings indicate that public participation has direct, significant, positive influences on public transport quality and public transport-related policies. In terms of policy implications, the authors suggest that policies designed to improve public transport service quality, extend public transport fare concessions, and promote public participation in the public transport policy decision-making process should be given priority in the next round of urban comprehensive planning in order to reduce public transport-related social inequity in Shenyang and China more generally.}

We aimed to investigate progress in reducing mortality rates from road traffic injury in China from 2006 to 2016.Methods We obtained data from national disease surveillance points. Crude and age-standardised mortality were calculated, with SEs. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to examine and quantify trends in overall and subgroup road traffic mortality from 2006 to 2016. Subgroup analyses were done by place (urban and rural), sex, age group, geographical location (province), and road user, and by type of vehicle for motor vehicle occupant deaths.Findings In 2016 in China, crude road traffic mortality was 11.0 (SE 0.11) deaths per 100 000 population. Overall age-adjusted road traffic mortality increased from 12.6 (SE 0.03) deaths per 100 000 population in 2006 to 15.5 (0.03) deaths per 100 000 population in 2011 then decreased to 10.4 (0.03) deaths per 100 000 population in 2016. Subgroup mortality rates generally followed similar trends. Males, older adults, and rural areas consistently had higher road traffic mortality rates than did females, younger people, and urban areas. Mortality changes varied across urban and rural areas and by sex, age group, and province between 2006 and 2016, revealing large urban-rural and provincial disparities and highlighting pedestrians as the most vulnerable road users. Deaths among occupants of cars and three-wheeled motor vehicles constituted 48\% and 20\%, respectively, of total occupant mortality from road traffic accidents between 2006 and 2016.Interpretation Despite a substantial decrease in road traffic mortality since 2011, the SDG target to halve deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2020 is unlikely to be reached in China.

With an activity-space measure and by weighting the importance of facilities, this study examines the differences in access to facilities between low- and non-low-income groups at both the individual and community levels using Nanjing as a case study. The results show that low-income individuals' access to public transit and commercial facilities is lower than that of individuals in the non-low-income group at the individual level. However, the differences in facility accessibility vary by community type. Participants living in danwei communities and traditional dilapidated communities have better access to facilities and services. However, low-income individuals who live in affordable housing have the lowest accessibility levels among the residents in the three different types of neighborhoods, resulting in their highest risk of social exclusion and isolation in disadvantaged spaces. The regression models reveal that individuals' socioeconomic attributes and characteristics of activities and built-environment attributes have different impacts on facility accessibility of participants of different communities. Social policies should support the equitable distribution of urban resources for different social groups, especially for vulnerable groups who live in affordable housing.}

This involved almost 100 participants from Cuba and the UK in the 12 months from June 2013.Overall, the study found a high degree of agreement amongst the transport policy community as to the three key transport issues facing Havana:high level of unmet demand,lack of available financing,poor state of the transport system.Perhaps more surprisingly, it also produced a near consensus amongst the participants that any future policy should seek to increase the quality of the public transport system by:increasing levels of investment,securing efficiency savings,working 'smarter'.However, it also found that this unified view is challenged by a desire for the car market to be deregulated, which would engender a very different policy approach. A strategic choice is needed now, to determine whether Havana follows a North American-style trajectory of rapid growth in car use or a less car-dependent pathway. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   abstract = {An equitable transit system can cater to the needs of captive riders and maximize transit service coverage. Historically transit equity has not considered in planning or has been an afterthought in the process; leading to the underutilization of transit and encouraging travelers to be auto dependent. In this paper, the authors propose a methodology to estimate transit equity using a number of attributes such as frequency, speed, capacity, and built environment in a multi-modal transit network. We propose a methodology to measure transit equity from a graph theoretical approach for all levels of transit service coverage integrating routes, schedules, socio-economic, demographic and spatial activity patterns. The objective of using equity is to quantify and evaluate transit service in terms of prioritizing transit locations for funding; conforming with federal regulations; providing service delivery strategies, especially for areas with large multi-jurisdictional, multi-modal transit networks; providing an indicator of multi-level transit capacity for planning purposes and assessing the effectiveness and efficiency for node/stop prioritization while choosing transit as a mode of travel. The methodology uses a stylized connectivity measure with a Gini index for equity estimation at different levels such as stop, line, zone and area. An example problem is presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The approach is then applied to the Washington–Baltimore region in the United States. The results show the existing transit service coverage at different locations. The proposed approach can be utilized as a tool for transit service planning.},

  abstract = {In the United States, federal agencies are required to work towards providing equal access to resources for minority and low-income populations. Access to quality public transportation is critical for mobility to many of these populations. Determining how transit service is distributed among vulnerable groups has the potential to significantly enhance policy analysis. While many measures of accessibility exist, due to the complexity of transit networks and the scale of the urban areas, limited research has been conducted on developing a tool to measure how equitable the distribution of transit access is in a region. This paper develops a comprehensive method to quantify the quality of service and accessibility at each transit node in a network, combined with an index to measure the inequity (concentration of quality service) at the micro scale. These measures are applied to the distribution of all residential housing units, a random sampling of units and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development subsidized units in Baltimore, Maryland; to determine if the subsidized housing programs are achieving major policy objectives of providing equitable transit access to vulnerable groups. The results show that transit connectivity and accessibility is distributed among some types of subsidized housing units more equitably than can be achieved by random sampling in the general population, but for other types, the distribution is less equitable; indicating some policies to enhance transit access among these units have not been effective. Evidence from this study suggests that developers of affordable housing and transportation planners should work together to find development locations that place more emphasis on transit locations with high connectivity rather than simply reducing distance to any transit.

This study investigates how accessibility issues are currently treated in Swedish municipalities in order to examine how the accessibility needs of older people are met in daily practice. A postal questionnaire was sent to all municipalities in Sweden (N=290) with questions mainly regarding three categories: (1) existence of policies \& planning documents, cooperation with interest organizations, and measures implemented, (2) awareness and use of governmental directives and recommendations relevant for accessibility issues and (3) statements of how accessibility issues are treated among municipal politicians and employees as perceived by the respondent. In the data analysis, a quantitative ranking of each one of the three categories was created using questions from the questionnaire to indicate the level of accessibility implemented in municipal planning. The results show a large variation in the accessibility standard among the municipalities in Sweden. In municipalities that have planning documents, e.g. accessibility plan, accessibility issues are treated more positively among the municipal politicians and employees. This positive relationship with the treatment of accessibility was also found with factors such as municipalities have an accessibility adviser employed, municipalities cooperate with senior organizations, and municipalities use governmental directives and recommendations relevant for accessibility issues. This paper concludes that although there is still much to do to accomplish a society accessible to all citizens, a majority of the Swedish municipalities are nevertheless positive to accessibility issues.},

   abstract = {In recent years, interest in the travel behavior of students in institutions of higher education has grown. It has been noted that students tend to use a variety of transportation modes, including active travel, more frequently than other population segments. Investigating the modal choice of university students provides a unique opportunity to understand a population that has a large proportion of active commuters at a major trip-generating location. In turn, this can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence active travel. In this paper, we report the results of a mode choice analysis among university students, using as a case study McMaster University, in Hamilton, Canada. The results from this research indicate that modal choices are influenced by a combination of cost, individual attitudes, and environmental factors such as street and sidewalk density. A key finding is that travel time by car and bicycle positively affect the utilities of these modes, although at a decreasing rate as travel time increases. While the positive utility of time spent traveling by car has been documented in other settings, our analysis provides evidence of the intrinsic value that cyclists place on their trip experience. Examples of transportation policy measures suggested by the analysis are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It has made society heavily car-dependent, increasing the vulnerability of society to adverse changes in social, economic, environmental, or other spheres. This paper analyzes how the spatial context shapes conditions for car dependency, specifically focusing on the case of the Netherlands. Our research shows that, except in the periphery of the country, most daily amenities are within walking or biking distance, both in cities as well as in suburban and rural areas. However, regarding accessibility to jobs, there is no competitive alternative to the car-even in central city areas, which provide many more travel choices. The differences are not only related to population density or land use within the city, as is often thought, but also to the position of the urban area in the regional spatial context (i.e., its location relative to other urban areas). The bicycle as an alternative transport mode to the car scores highest in monocentric urban regions and in the central areas of cities close to a coastline or a national border. Public transport scores highest in central areas of medium-sized cities in polycentric regions and satellite towns near big cities.}

To evaluate the effectiveness of this model in addressing equity, various standardisation functions in both Non-Spatial Preference Modelling and SPM are compared. The evaluation involves applying the model to a resource location-allocation problem for transport infrastructure in the Special Province of Yogyakarta in Indonesia. We apply Amartya Sen's Capability Approach to define opportunity to mobility as a non-income indicator. Using the extended Moran's I interpretation for spatial equity, we evaluate the distribution output regarding, first, 'the spatial distribution patterns of priority targeting for allocation' (SPT) and, second, 'the effect of new distribution patterns after location-allocation' (ELA). The Moran's I index of the initial map and its comparison with six patterns for SPT as well as ELA consistently indicates that the SPM is more effective for addressing spatial equity. We conclude that the inclusion of spatial neighbourhood comparison factors in Preference Modelling improves the capability of SDSS to address spatial equity. This study thus proposes a new formal method for SDSS with specific attention on resource location-allocation to address spatial equity.}

This paper contributes to the existing literature by (1) evaluating the activity spaces of individuals with visual impairment (VI) in the San Francisco Bay Area and (2) comparing the activity space results to qualitative information about individuals' travel behaviors and their perceptions about the accessibility of their environments. This mixed quantitative and qualitative methods project models individuals' activity spaces from travel diaries and analyzes participants' travel behaviors and perceptions from interviews. Three activity space measures are considered: standard deviational ellipse, network buffer, and potential path area. The results demonstrate significant shortcomings in activity space measures for representing the experiences of people with visual impairment and identify how existing methods can be improved for future research on environmental accessibility.}

  abstract = {Background In sub-Saharan Africa, women are most likely to receive skilled and adequate childbirth care in hospital settings, yet the use of hospital for childbirth is low and inequitable. The poorest and those living furthest away from a hospital are most affected. But the relative contribution of poverty and travel time is convoluted, since hospitals are often located in wealthier urban places and are scarcer in poorer remote area. This study aims to partition the variability in hospital-based childbirth by poverty and travel time in four sub-Saharan African countries. Methods We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Tanzania. For each country, geographic coordinates of survey clusters, the master list of hospital locations and a high-resolution map of land surface friction were used to estimate travel time from each DHS cluster to the nearest hospital with a shortest-path algorithm. We quantified and compared the predicted probabilities of hospital-based childbirth resulting from one standard deviation (SD) change around the mean for different model predictors. Results The mean travel time to the nearest hospital, in minutes, was 27 (Kenya), 31 (Malawi), 25 (Nigeria) and 62 (Tanzania). In Kenya, a change of 1SD in wealth led to a 33.2 percentage points change in the probability of hospital birth, whereas a 1SD change in travel time led to a change of 16.6 percentage points. The marginal effect of 1SD change in wealth was weaker than that of travel time in Malawi (13.1 vs. 34.0 percentage points) and Tanzania (20.4 vs. 33.7 percentage points). In Nigeria, the two were similar (22.3 vs. 24.8 percentage points) but their additive effect was twice stronger (44.6 percentage points) than the separate effects. Random effects from survey clusters also explained substantial variability in hospital-based childbirth in all countries, indicating other unobserved local factors at play. Conclusions Both poverty and long travel time are important determinants of hospital birth, although they vary in the extent to which they influence whether women give birth in a hospital within and across countries. This suggests that different strategies are needed to effectively enable poor women and women living in remote areas to gain access to skilled and adequate care for childbirth.}

Many previous studies have focused primarily on the socio-demographics environments of subsidized housing, but it remains unknown if subsidized housing programs facilitate disadvantaged populations' access to walkable environments. Furthermore, little attention has been devoted to the potential differences in walkability of the environments provided by tenant-based programs such as Housing Choice Voucher (HCV), and project-based programs like the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). This study examined the spatial distribution of HCV and LIHTC housing units and their environmental attributes in the American city of Austin, Texas. Binary logistic regression models were used to estimate various walkable environments around subsidized households. We found that the walkability characteristics varied between the two subsidized housing programs. HCV households were mostly in neighborhoods with high accessibility to amenities and significant sidewalk completeness, but had low densities of crosswalks and transit stops. Meanwhile, LIHTC households were principally found in census block groups characterized by poor sidewalk completeness. Other walkability features, such as the Street Smart Walk Score and the crosswalk density, were not significantly related to neighborhoods containing LIHTC households. These findings will help planning practitioners understand the spatial attributes of subsidized households and better improve their neighborhood walkability.}

On the basis of two user groups differing in values of time, first-best pricing is shown to remain possible through the use of anonymous charges under the stochastic user equilibrium condition. Second-best pricing is also examined, in which an equity constraint is introduced to ensure that some users, if not all, are at least not worse off from implementing the pricing at expectation level. The efficiency, equity, demand realization, and modal split resulting from various pricing strategies are investigated and numerically validated in a simplified real network connecting the Kowloon urban area to Hong Kong, China, International Airport. It was found that the equity-constrained second-best pricing can result in a win-win situation for society and users.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prescribes the minimum accessibility requirements for transit stops for riders with disabilities. In addition, transit agencies may also choose to implement the "universal-design" paradigm, which involves higher design standards than current ADA requirements and includes amenities that are useful for all riders, such as shelters and lighting. Because of budget limitations, however, transit agencies can select only a limited number of transit stops for ADA improvements each year. To increase the impact of these improvements, it is desirable that transit stops be selected such that they will maximize the overall benefits to patrons with disabilities. This paper describes a multiobjective binary nonlinear programming model for selecting, within a limited annual budget, a priority set of transit stops for improvements. The model aims to achieve two objectives, namely, meeting the minimum ADA standards and the universal-design standards. Compared with the traditional approach of selecting stops for improvements, which are often based on either staff experience or requests from elected officials, the optimization approach described in this paper provides a more objective platform to identify better candidate stops for ADA improvements.

  abstract = {Urban green spaces can promote physical activity, well-being, and public health, but disparities in the distribution of such spaces predominantly benefit affluent communities. Therefore, green justice issues have become a focus of academic research. In this paper, we develop a new model, the comprehensive floating catchment area (CFCA), to measure the accessibility of urban green space. The CFCA models urban green space attractiveness as a function of park size and of street green views from residential zones to parks. Three transportation modes (walking, biking, and driving a car) are compared. We take the central urban area of Beijing as the research area and measure green justice across different economic residential zones using the ordinary least squares model. The results suggest that the spatial disparities of urban green space are significant when only polygon urban green spaces are considered, regardless of the transportation mode. However, green injustice is mitigated when we consider both urban green spaces and street greening. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to study green justice by taking a street green view, and the results of this study can provide guidance on urban green space development for government leaders and researchers in the future.}

  abstract = {Social equity can be potentially improved by well-designed transit systems. However, dissatisfaction with transit is commonly reported within an area due to an intricate process to allocate the resources. Thus, it is critical to quantify transit equity for vulnerable groups. Based on the prior literature, this study includes 683 affordable housing units in the City of Seattle to quantify transit equity using spatial principal component analysis. The factors include the built environments, sociodemographic, and transit access and service. The result suggests the level of transit service play a key role in explaining transit equity, followed by indicators of street design, and sociodemographic factors. Land use and transit access seems of lower weight in relation to transit equity. In addition, densely developed areas, including downtown and university areas, present a high degree of transit equity than outskirts. The identified areas of more segregated from transit are in the outside areas of downtown, and some inside areas of rich neighborhoods. The findings of this study inform the location choice of affordable housing where transit access and affordable housing should be jointly considered. Densely developed regions are more suitable for developing new affordable housing programs. To avoid building segregated affordable housing units, when making changes in transit, the selection of routes and stops may prioritize the coverage to transit underserved areas.}

The transportation disadvantaged groups not only face the problems of social exclusion in location, but also experience greater exposure to a diversity of social and environmental threat. Under this context, identifying the transportation disadvantaged neighborhoods is of great interest for urban planners. This paper examines the transportation disadvantage in association with neighborhood sociodemographics in Shenzhen, China. A set of multidimensional indicators are initially selected to measure the transportation disadvantage (physical conditions, public transport services, education opportunity, employment opportunity, medical care opportunity, food opportunity, and commercial opportunity). Based on these indicators, principal component analysis produces four composite indicators of different types of transportation disadvantage: transportation disadvantage in physical infrastructure and public services, transportation disadvantage in food and education accessibility, transportation disadvantage in medical care accessibility, and transportation disadvantage in commercial and employment accessibility. In space, the transportation disadvantaged neighborhoods are generally located in the outskirts. Transportation disadvantage is more likely to be observed in neighborhoods that are economically, educationally, residentially and occupationally disadvantaged. These findings reveal significant inequalities in transportation opportunity.}

Whilst many UK cities have had some success increasing overall cycling numbers in recent years, women are still far less likely to cycle, often because of concerns with journey quality related to traffic safety and social safety. CLoS tools are used by planners and engineers to assess existing routes and ensure they are safe, direct and continuous. However, whilst CLoS tools are seen to provide objective measures of some principles, we argue that they fail to attribute enough importance to gendered differences in perceptions of social safety. Based upon qualitative go-along and interview data, we assess the Welsh CLoS tool, demonstrating that it allows routes considered to be unrideable by female cyclists to be designated as rideable because there is no requirement to take mandatory remedial action regarding what are shown to be critically low scores on indicators of social safety. Whilst larger studies are required to validate these findings, our data suggests that the safety component of the CLoS tool can only be considered objective from a male point of view and inadequately considers the perspectives and needs of women. Moreover, we argue that in mandating socially unsafe routes as safe, CLoS actively reproduces gendered 'essences' such as vulnerability. As a result we suggest that CLoS urgently needs to be incorporated into gender and equalities audits if it is to accurately reflect the needs of more diverse user groups.}

Considering the varying types and functions of PGSs, this study proposed a multi-mode method that is based on the traditional two-step floating catchment area method and relied on PGS classification to estimate spatial disparity between the supply of PGSs services and residents' demands in accessibility. Choosing the urban center of Wuhan as the study area, comparative analysis of space and statistics were conducted in accessibility between the traditional single-mode and the multi-mode methods. After a sensitive analysis of accessibility with varying travel time thresholds, underserved areas in the urban center were identified on a community level based on the PGS groups. Results indicated that the estimated accessibility average and standard deviation values by single-mode method were slimly higher than that of the multi-mode method. The average and standard deviation values of the accessibility among five time thresholds exhibited slight difference and an increasing trend. The further examination analysis of spatial accessibility in 25-min threshold demonstrated that accessibility presented spatial polarization and that most underserved areas distributed in the eastern and southwestern of the urban center in Wuhan. The findings may provide a more realistic estimation and further the knowledge of access to green spaces to help decision makers developing equal and effective planning policies and strategies.}

Previous literature has examined the social inequalities of park accessibility under the Western context; however, the issue has seldomly investigated against the non-Western background, especially in China. Using a case of Shenzhen (China), this paper examines the accessibility to parks of three quality levels (official standard) under four transport modes (public transit, walking, bicycle, and private car). In particular, the daily travel time from each community (8117) to each park (625) was harvested from the Baidu Map during 18:30-20:30 in July 2016. We further, based on the travel time calculations, develop four baseline indicators (the weighted average, the minimum, the maximum, and the standard deviation travel time) and three tolerance indicators of park accessibility (weighted average travel time within visit tolerance thresholds, standard deviation travel time within visit tolerance thresholds, and number of parks within visit tolerance thresholds) to measure park accessibility for each community. Results show that the seven accessibility indicators generate different estimations and the quantified accessibility varies greatly with park quality levels and transport modes. Communities present greater variations in accessibility to the first quality level and second quality level parks via walking and public transit. In addition, hierarchical regression is utilized to quantify the relationships between park accessibility and sociodemographic characteristics at two geographic levels (community and district). It is found that the associations are subjected to park quality, transport modes, and geographic levels. In particular, we discover significant social inequalities in park accessibility under the mode of public transit, walking, and bicycle. Our study should provide some new insights into accessibility research and advance the understanding of unequal park provision in developing countries.}

This paper deals with carpooling behavior and optimal congestion pricing in a multilane highway with or without HOV lanes. It is shown that in the absence of HOV lanes, a uniform toll for all vehicles (independent of their number of occupants) should be charged to achieve a first-best social optimum. However, in the presence of HOV lanes, first-best pricing for a social optimum requires differentiating the toll per vehicle across segregated lanes. In the case where toll differentiation cannot be applied, the optimal uniform toll for the second-best solution in the presence of HOV lanes should be set to be a weighted average of the marginal external congestion costs between non-carpooling and carpooling commuters. Our theoretical observations have strong practical implications for combined implementation of HOV lanes and congestion pricing. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.},

Hurricane evacuation intrinsically involves both social and spatial processes. People's decision to evacuate spreads over social networks; once their decisions are made, they flee through spatial transportation networks. This article describes a novel effort to integrate socio-spatial networks into an agent-based evacuation simulation model, taking the Florida Keys in the USA as a study area. In the model, households, as agents, were synthesized from Census data, then connected by a 'home-workplace-neighborhood' social network, and registered to a spatial road network. A threshold decision model was used to simulate social contagion of households' decision to evacuate. The resulting travel demands were input into the TRANSIMS platform to generate on-road traffic. The model analyzed scenarios of automobile-only and public transit-assisted evacuation. The results show that the simulated traffic under the automobile-only scenario aligns with the observed traffic dynamics, which validates our socio-spatially integrated model. Adding public transportation capacity significantly reduces the traffic load and evacuation time, and provides a practical, accessible, and equitable route to safety for low mobility populations.}

In the current research, two spatial distance accessibility measures were applied to evaluate the accessibility to amenities, services, and facilities (ASFs) from public transit (PT) by walking distance in six Indian cities. The first stage accounts for distance measures using the Euclidean distance with a new methodical approach derived from the built-up area with a spatial resolution of 30 m from Landsat data, and for the network distance method, the actual road distances using OpenStreetMap (OSM) for different threshold ranges of distances were derived. Meanwhile, in the second stage, indicators such as built-up area, network connectivity, and network density with the percentage of ASFs are evaluated and combined for normalization process for ranking the city. The present study assesses the accessibility to various ASFs from PT at city level and explores whether the actual road network access (by measuring distance) in Indian cities is contributing to a high level of accessibility. It adopts a unique approach using statistical tools while assessing both Euclidean and network distances. It models a framework for overall benchmarking in all six cities by ranking them for their accessibility. The results show various scenarios in terms of the rank of cities, which had been strongly affected by distance metrics (Euclidean vs. network) and thus emphasize the careful use of these measures as supporting tools for planning. This facilitates the identification of the local barriers and problems with network access that affect the actual distance. This unique approach can help policymakers to identify the gaps in PT coverage for reaching ASFs. Furthermore, it helps in crucial implementation by strategic planning that can be achieved using these distance criteria.}

This paper reports the development of a multidimensional framework through a review of the literature and based on a Delphi survey. A range of dimensions and indicators of TRSE were identified through the review. Their suitability was assessed by the experts through a two-round Delphi survey - involving 33 international experts. These experts reached a consensus that individuals are likely to face TRSE in physical, economic, temporal, spatial, psychological, and information dimensions, which can be measured by 15 key indicators consisting of 47 sub-indicators. The findings of this research serve as a guide for scholars and policymakers to understand what constitutes TRSE and act accordingly.}

Many previous studies have evaluated the disparities in park access among various social groups, but few researchers have considered the heterogeneity of the built environment in residential communities. This study revisits an increasingly popular Gaussian-two-step floating catchment area (G2SFCA) model and mainly improves its two core parameters, the comprehensive supply indicator and variable catchment, in order to realistically evaluate park accessibility under different travel modes. We choose Nanjing city, China, as the study case in which to evaluate differences in public park access with respect to gated and open communities using our improved model. Moreover, gated communities have been further divided into three categories, which represent differences in a community's ability to provide daily physical activities, to more deeply explore disparities in public park services. The results show that (1) the spatial accessibility of parks in Nanjing city is not evenly distributed, with communities located north of the Yangtze River having inferior park accessibility; (2) residents who live in open communities are more restricted with regard to access to parks than those in gated communities, although they experience relatively small differences under the walking mode; (3) gated communities with no internal park ("club park") enjoy better public park services; and (4) residents living in 105 open communities and 167 gated communities without a club park can be regarded as the most vulnerable groups based on the lack of park services. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for policy makers to target specific communities of vulnerable groups for further urban park development.}

   abstract = {Rapid urbanization and a drastic socioeconomic transition from the centrally planned system to a market system in China provide a rare opportunity of observing urban transport equity. Literature on urban transport equity in Chinese cities is increasing. However, our understanding of urban transport equity in China is dominated by individual empirical studies, and an overall picture remains absent. This paper contributes the first literature review on urban transport equity in transitional China. Two key questions are answered. They are how transport equity is understood and examined in China, and what progress can be made to obtain universal knowledge of urban transport equity. This paper addresses the two questions by engaging with recent theoretical dialogue between the political philosophy of justice and Western transport equity research. This theoretical dialogue reconceptualizes transport equity into the equitable accessibility distribution mediated by institutional architecture to achieve equality of social opportunity among people. Based on a critical review of equity-concerned China transportation research and its reconceptualization, we propose an agenda for furthering urban transport equity research in transitional China. This research agenda calls for a shifted research focus (a) on evaluating the accessibility distribution of specific transport projects and policy, (b) on unpacking the political economy of transitional urban transport governance that determines the triumph/failure of the pro-growth/pro-equity accessibility distribution in the real setting, (c) on tracking the impact of accessibility distribution on disadvantaged groups' socioeconomic status and social mobility and putting forward appropriate policy/institution to improve the accessibility of disadvantaged groups, and (d) on revealing how the emerging social trends (e.g., information technology revolution and the aging society) reshape the individual capability to move/accessibility distribution.},

This incurs severe travel delays for commuters and safety risks for metro operators. Hence, passenger flow management and control becomes an essential way to reduce station congestion during high-peak hours. This paper investigates the passenger flow control problem with the objective of increasing the number of boarding passengers. Considering the scenario that the destination of each passenger entering the station is unknown, a flow control problem with dynamic and station-based constraints is proposed to dynamically determine the number of passengers boarding each train at each station. Compared with existing flow control strategies, this model can improve the equity for boarding passengers of different OD pairs. The station-based flow control problem is formulated as a complicated nonlinear nonconvex quadratic programming model. To solve the intractable nonlinear programming model, we reformulate it into the dynamic programming formation and develop two efficient heuristic algorithms to solve it. We carry out two sets of numerical experiments, including the small-scale case with synthetic data and the real-world case with the operation data of Beijing metro system, to evaluate the performance of our model and algorithms. Several performance indicators, e.g. average waiting time and Gini coefficient, are presented to verify the efficiency and fairness of proposed model. The numerical results applied to Beijing urban subway network indicate that our approach can reduce the passengers' waiting time and the line-level Gini coefficient by 5.21\% and 23.52\% compared with the benchmark flow control strategy with maximum loading and station-based constraints.}

However, the existing literature in the field is dominated by the evidence from cities, while the evidence from rural areas remains scarce. In particular, mobility equity in rural areas in developing countries needs to be paid more attention since a large proportion of people in these countries still live in undeveloped rural areas. This paper contributes to new evidence of mobility and its inequity in rural areas of China. By using questionnaire data from a nationwide survey in 2016, this study investigates the rural residents' mobility characteristics with transport equity concerns and the determinants of mobility inequity. Individual people's trips amount, travel mode, and travel range are used as three main indicators for rural residents' mobility. A number of 12,524 residents from rural townships and 2,952 villagers were analysed. The results of analysis show those who live in poor areas or areas far from the city have low-level mobility. The socially disadvantaged groups had lower mobility, such as the elderly over the age of 60, women, and people from low-income households. Mobility inequity even exists in rural areas between township residents and villagers. The township residents have a higher level of mobility than rural villagers. Regression results show rural people's mobility is significantly affected by car ownership and public bus services. The policies designed to improve quality and equity of mobility in the rural areas in China should focus on not only the huge rural mad constructions but also the improvements in public transport services and car ownership.}

The situation seems to be worse in growing megacities where more than 10 million people live and rapid urban sprawl has caused serious problems with the supply of health and public transport services. The recent global COVID-19 pandemic calls for particular attention to be afforded to the matter of equal access to basic medical facilities and services for people across different neighborhoods. Although some studies have already been undertaken into the subject of health-focused inequality in the cities of developing countries, the spatial inequity in hospital accessibility has rarely been discussed to date. In this paper, I aim to provide new evidence by considering Beijing as a case study. With the results of my analysis, I show that lowincome neighborhoods have experienced lower levels of accessibility not only to high-tier hospitals (secondary and tertiary hospitals) but also to primary healthcare services (primary hospital and neighborhood clinics). The rate at which high-income neighborhoods access secondary and tertiary hospitals is approximately 4 times and 1.5 times as high as that of low-income neighborhoods. Low-income face nearly twice the travel time of those from high-income neighborhoods to reach the nearest primary hospital or neighborhood clinics. Suburban neighborhoods have less access to medical services than neighborhoods that are located in the central urban areas. It seems that the rapid urban sprawl has been worsening spatial inequality in the context of access to medical services in the growing megacity of Beijing. Equal access to healthcare services should be prioritized in future policy discussions, especially in relation to the urban growth management of megacities in developing countries in order to ensure that fair and inclusive urbanization processes are undertaken. Equal access to healthcare services would also be widely beneficial in the context of managing the COVID-19 pandemic.}

The authors reports that cycling on sidewalks in Japan was permitted beginning in 1978 after deregulation of the Road Traffic Law, which was passed to secure cyclists’ safety due to a lack of safe space in the roadways.  Although bicycles are still regarded as a vehicle and when cyclists choose to use the roads they must follow the Road Traffic Law, many bicycle users prefer to use sidewalks.  The authors outline the advantages and disadvantages of shared bicycle and pedestrian use of the sidewalks.  Issues discussed include the safety and amenity of pedestrians, the reduction of cycling speed, and safety and freedom for utility cyclists, defined as the use of bicycles for going shopping or to school.  The authors completed a video survey of shared use streets to analyze the relationship between cycling speed, frequency of hindrance and traffic density or traffic volume of street users.  Their study results support the coexistence of bicycles and pedestrians with conditions including less than 0.5 pedestrians/minute/mile and less than 3.0 cyclists/minute/mile.  The standard for pedestrian/bicycle share use in terms of hourly traffic volume was found to be less than 26 pedestrians/hour and 108 cyclists/hour for 2 meter-wide sidewalks.}

The gain and loss for VOT-based user groups are investigated and discussed. We carry out simulation analysis over two pricing schemes: a unified toll and a VOT-based toll. In particular, we allow during the optimization process the VOT-based toll to obtain negative values for some users if it meets some system objectives. Our results confirm that significant differences in behavior and cost savings exist among groups, which justifies the need for a VOT-based pricing. It also demonstrates that properly-designed VOT-based tolls can improve the inequity in savings, e.g. users whose VOT values are lower may receive larger travel cost savings. Furthermore, a policy-oriented discussion on the design and implementation of the proposed equitable pricing schemes is provided.},

  abstract = {The expansion of urban space makes citizens more dependent on cars, resulting in various urban environmental and traffic problems. Advocating low-carbon travel and building a sustainable low-carbon city are the major trends of urban development. Many scholars have pointed out that the urban spatial environment will lead residents to change their travel modes, but the residents' travel patterns will also have an impact on the urban spatial layout. Based on the interaction between the two, most of the studies have been evaluated and studied from the level of rail transit and normal bus transit. The traffic volume level of trams lies between the rail transit and the normal public transit. However, the research and discussion on the relationship between the surrounding land use and residents' travel behaviors are not yet perfect domestically. This paper takes Nanjing Chilin Tram Line 1 in China as the research object, combines the research of the the social attributes of the passengers who live along the tram line and the psychological accessing threshold of different travel purposes, provides analysis and evaluations of the coupling degree between the present situation of land use around its various stations and the residents' actual travel demand with the measure of accessibility. The traffic volume level of trams lies between the rail transit and the normal public transit.

Taking Nanjing Chilin Tram Line 1 in China as the research object, this paper combines the research of the the social attributes of the passengers who live along the tram line and the psychological accessing threshold of different travel purposes. Furthermore, based on the measure of accessibility, it provides the analysis and evaluations of the coupling degree between the present situation of land use around its various stations and the residents' actual travel demand. The research method of this paper is divided into three parts. Firstly, based on the questionnaire and OD survey, the coupling degree between the type of the station along the tram line and the distribution of passenger flow and the purpose of passenger travel is analyzed. Secondly, the KLP model is used to calculate and determine the effective influence range of the tram through the critical accessing distance for pedestrians psychologically. Based on different psychological thresholds for different purposes, the land use index within the influence range of the station is evaluated and analyzed, and the controlled circle of land use around each type of station is defined. Finally, the coupling degree between the actual land use status in each circle and residents' psychological threshold with different purposes is analyzed, and the optimization strategy is proposed from the coupling degree between the overall station type \& passenger flow along the line and the land use layout around the station \& the residents' psychological threshold.}

  abstract = {In December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic attacked Wuhan, China. The city government soon strictly locked down the city, implemented a hierarchical diagnosis and treatment system, and took a series of unprecedented pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures. The residents' access to the medical resources and the consequently potential demand-supply tension may determine effective diagnosis and treatment, for which travel distance and time are key indicators. Using the Application Programming Interface (API) of Baidu Map, we estimated the travel distance and time from communities to the medical facilities capable of treating COVID-19 patients, and we identified the service areas of those facilities as well. The results showed significant differences in service areas and potential loading across medical facilities. The accessibility of medical facilities in the peripheral areas was inferior to those in the central areas; there was spatial inequality of medical resources within and across districts; the amount of community healthcare centers was insufficient; some communities were underserved regarding walking distance; some medical facilities could be potentially overloaded. This study provides reference, in the context of Wuhan, for understanding the spatial aspect of medical resources and residents' relevant mobility under the emergency regulation, and re-examining the coordination of emergency to improve future planning and utilization of medical facilities at various levels. The approach can facilitate policymakers to assess potential loading of medical facilities, identify low-accessibility areas, and deploy new medical facilities. It also implies that the accessibility analysis can be rapid and relevant even only with open-source data.}

  abstract = {It is of great significance both in theory and in practice to propose an efficient approach to approximating visual walkability given urban residents' growing leisure needs. Recent advancements in sensing and computing technologies provide new opportunities in this regard. This paper first proposes a conceptual framework for understanding street visual walkability and then employs deep learning technologies to segment and extract physical features from Baidu Map Street View (BMSV) imagery using the case of Shenzhen City in China. Guided by this framework, four indicators are calculated based on the segmented imagery and further integrated into the visual walkability index (VWI), whose reliability is validated through manual interpretation and a subjective scoring experiment. Our results show that deep learning technologies achieve higher accuracy in segmenting street view imagery than the traditional K-means clustering algorithm and support vector machine algorithm. Moreover, the developed VWI is effective to measure visual walkability, and it presents great heterogeneity across streets within Shenzhen. Spatial regression further identifies that significant social inequalities are associated with neighborhood visual walkability. According to the findings, implications and suggestions on planning the healthy city are proposed. The methodological procedure is reduplicative and can be applied to other unfeasible or challenging cases.}

This study identifies multi-level correlates of walking to/from school and relevant policy implications. We surveyed parents/guardians of 2,695 students from 19 elementary schools in Austin, Texas, which featured diverse sociodemographic and environmental characteristics. Among the personal and social factors, negative correlates were parents' education, car ownership, personal barriers, and school bus availability; positive correlates were parents' and children's positive attitude and regular walking behavior, and supportive peer influences. Of physical environmental factors, the strongest negative correlates were distance and safety concerns, followed by the presence of highways/freeways, convenience stores, office buildings, and bus stops en route. Our findings suggest that society should give high priority to lower socioeconomic status populations and to multi-agency policy interventions that facilitate environmental changes, safety improvements, and educational programs targeting both parents and children.}

  abstract = {To more effectively expand transit service coverage through promoting bicycling, a practical approach is presented in the paper for estimating the coverage of transit service accessible by non-motorized modes (i.e. walking and bicycling). The non-motorized accessibility to transit is determined by the connectivity and facilities of non motorized network. Using the data from 2009 to 2010 GPS-based Household Travel Survey in the Cincinnati metropolitan area, the study examines distance thresholds of such non-motorized transit access trips and identifies the spatial boundary and geographic area of transit catchment areas in the Geographic Information System environment. Results suggest that bicycle enables people to access the transit service. The bicycle-transit catchment area is estimated as 1.7 and 2.3 times of the size of pedestrian-transit catchment area at home and activity ends respectively. As a result, more households and employment can reach the transit service via bicycling than walking (52.45\% vs. 36.72\% for households and 47.82\%. vs. 33.07\% for employment in the study area). Suburbs, where near half of population and employment situate, are comparatively underserved. Especially, only 27.14\% \% of the disadvantaged population in suburbs, can access transit by walking, but the percent is increased to 50.96\% if using a bicycle. Besides the distance threshold, the non-motorized accessibility to transit is found to be a significant factor determining transit catchment areas. The transit service area can be expanded if a safer and more comfortable bicycling environment is available. Those findings can also be further used as references in the transit-oriented development planning.}
