"Equity dimension 1: mobility and accessibilty"	"@rivasHowAffordableTransportation2018"	"Analyses how affordable urban public transportation is in select Latin American and Caribbean countries. They look at the assumed average monthly cost of urban transit trips and average monthly household income and conceptualize **transportation-related** **affordability**, especially for the most economically vulnerable (**vertical equity**)."	"**Population** **standards**: The financial burden of a basket of urban public transportation trips (60 trip fares, representing 30 round-trips per month) should not exceed 10% of household monthly income."
"Equity dimension 1: mobility and accessibilty"	"North America (USA - National)"	"This study designed a web-based tool and took a representative sample of wheeled mobility device (WhMD) users anthropometry measurements to determine if the minimum standard suggested by the ADA is sufficient. We understand this conceptualization as a type of Rights conceptualization that WhMD should have minimum clear floor space (as described the guidelines in line with the American Disabilities Act) to access bus shelters, bus stop pads, and transit terminals."	"Infrastructure standard: The clear floor area for wheelchairs: 760 mm (30 in.) wide by 1220 mm (48 in.) in length as described by the ADA standards. Notable, is that this minimum clear floor area is insufficient for a variety of the WhMD users."
"Equity dimension 1: mobility and accessibilty"	"Europe (Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo cities in Sweden)"	"Investigates what the literature and planning process is missing when we measure accessibility by comparing objective and self-reported accounts of accessibility among older people. This paper conceptualizes accessibility as from the position of the capabilities approach and vertical equity (particularly acknowledging that older people have capabilities that differ from the general population)."	"Population and Opportunity standards. Specifically for older populations (aged 65+), the following travel distances are suggested as equitable trip lengths to grocery stores per mode: Walking: less than or equal to 1500m, Combined public transit and walking (less than or equal to 1000m (walking element)), Combined car and walking: less than or equal to 1000m less than or equal to 1000m (walking element)), Bicycle: less than or equal to 3000m in addition to travel time threshold of less than 15 mins."
"Equity dimension 1: mobility and accessibilty"	"Asia (Yogyakarta, Indonesia)"	"Spatial Preference Modelling for equitable infrastructure provision: an application of Sens Capability Approach. Conceptualizes equity through Sens Capabilities Approach and spatial equity."	"Opportunity standards: Areas below the relative poverty line (of its neighbours) can only be located transport resources (i.e., measure in person*kms that can be travelled at car speed, i.e., mobility) based on the following 2 benchmarks (they can be considered, together as the floor/minmum access): 1) Global: standard deviation (SD) distance to mean should be minimized. 2) Local: priority to minimise the differences with its neighbourhood"
"Equity dimension 1: mobility and accessibilty"	"North America"	"This paper conceptualizies equity in the multimodal network (transit, car) being fair toll-pricing across differences in populatins value of time (VOT). VOT is determined based on household income, with lower income households having lower VOT and thus deserving of lower tolls (vertical equity). From this perspective, a utilitarian perspective that seeks to minimize multimodal traffic congestion through introducing toll-pricing based on VOT is implemented."	"Infrastructure standard: They demonstrate that a toll-pricing scheme based on individuals travel value-of-time (lower income people have a lower VOT) is equitable."
