# Introduction

<!-- defining transportation equity, and why it is important-->

An equitable transportation system, from a transportation planning perspective, can be broadly defined as the fair production, distribution, and reproduction of transportation benefits, and burdens within a community [@pereiraDistributiveJusticeEquity2017a]. It should focus on the socio-economic groups over which these benefits and burdens are distributed and some distributive benchmark that determines what is or is not equitable (or "morally proper") across a variety of dimensions such as mobility/accessibility, air pollution, traffic safety, and health [@lucasMeasuringTransportEquity2019]. Though equity often concerns itself with distributions of transportation burden/benefits, it *can* be mapped onto core concepts of justice. The calls for justice within our im/mobility systems are intensifying within practice and proliferating within academic research spaces. (XXX). There is a neeed. But how do we go about planning equitable and just transportation systems?

<!-- Begining to distinguish between justice and equity, and the aim of the review -->

The distinction between equity and justice is important and significant. Within the realm of transportation, concepts of distributive ("fair share") justice are often theorized, along with procedural ("fair processes") justice and restorative ("putting things back together as they were") justice. Justice questions can be centered through expressions of "what" (is the thing of in/justice), "who" (is or is not impacted), "where", "when", and "why" (root causes). Justice is much more than just equity, but both are topics of concern for transportation researchers, planners, and organizers (X). <!-- pereira and karner 2021-->

<!-- Reviewing justice concepts within an example-->

Take the reality of long transit wait times for core transit riders. Identifying and addressing this perceived inequity is the focus of activists (X), planning guidelines (X), and academic researchers (X). This issue can be theorized from a **distributive justice** perspective by looking to expand service for these neighbours such that wait times are similar to other neighbourhoods [@pereiraDistributiveJusticeEquity2017a]. The equity in distribution (and what is evaluated) can be theorized through the distributional justice lens. **Procedural justice** could look like adjusting transit planning guidelines such that core transit users perceive the distribution of wait times are sufficient (building on distributive justice). **Restorative justice** could look the compensation of core transit riders for lost time due to long transit wait times in the past in addition to measures of distributive and procedural justice. Justice is ultimately what is fair for those who experience injustice. Realms of justice are often cross-cutting depending on who/what/where/when/how the injustice is approached.

Cross-cutting justice theories related to transportation are numerous. **Environmental justice** is a large body of research that concerns environmental pollution that can be connected to transportation systems: for instance, the 1960s highway expansion project through lower-income and communities of colour. **Mobility justice** cross-cuts many realms of justice and seeks to understand how broader power inequities like racism, sexism and classism, inform the governance and control of movement and reproduced by mobility systems [@shellerMobilityJusticePolitics2018].

<!-- The aim of the paper -->

Interest in equitable and just transportation planning has proliferated in the past decades (XX) and the calls for mobility justice within communities continues (XX). Within transportation planning academic literature, equity has been conceptualized and operationalization through measures in a variety of ways. but it is unclear in what ways, if at all, there has been consensus on what a just transportation system looks like and is operated by.

As mentioned, though justice touches on aspects of equity, equity is not justice [@karnerTransportationEquityTransportation2020]: Justice is at the core of understanding socio-spatial phenomenon [@przybylinskiWhereJusticeGeography2022]. Understanding the distinction is important and how equity can be used within justice is crucial to building and sustaining fair transportation systems. This paper responds to these calls by conducting a scoping review of recent peer-reviewed literature and planning documents to see what theories have been implemented and if any standards/thresholds have been applied globally. This is the widest and most in-depth literature review on just transportation planning done to date.

To inform this review, principles of justice as they correspond to production of injustice and the distribution of benefits and costs of transportation planning are first reviewed, then academic literature <!-- then planning documents??-->, and lastly a discussion of findings. We aim to outline definitive terminology and how it has been applied in literature, building off XXX.

# Methods

## Search query creation, equity dimensions and screening

We screened for papers that related to transportation systems and had some sort of equity dimension. The categories:

| Equity dimensions                               | Definitions                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Quality of service                              | Related to user satisfaction with transportation service and/or objective measures (i.e., service frequency, road quality, congestion, crowding).                                                   |
| Affordability                                   | Associated with socio-economic conditions of users and/or user-fees (e.g., housing affordability related to transportation, transport affordability, transport user fees)                           |
| Pollution- air, noise, visual                   | Pollution as a result of transportation systems or modes.                                                                                                                                           |
| Energy                                          | Related to transportation energy consumption and/or related concepts (e.g., fuel poverty).                                                                                                          |

The above tables - all the equity conceptualizations categories. Most were created before data extraction. Starred categories were created after data extraction through synthesis.

The following is the standards categories. These were created after data synthesis, as the standards took form in a variety of ways. See the origin equity standards within the protocol (LINK):

| Equity standards                    | Definitions\* all can be relative, minimum, or maximum standards.                                                                                                                                                  |

How exactly do equity conceptualization, dimensions and standard intersect? Let's take an example. [@adlakhaMindGapGender2020] focuses on *horizontal equity* that is the conceptualization. The population of interest are Indian women and the measure of equity is physical activity levels achieved (i.e., relative equity across gendered groups is achieved horizontal equity). The equity *dimensions* are activity participation and health as related to transport systems. This study is concerned about the gendered differences in walkability and conceptualizes equity as a minimum physical activity level being met by all genders as an equity configuration. In this way, the conceptualization (horizontal equity) is concerned about the dimensions of activity participation, and the standard is a minimum activity limit being met.

Summary:

-   single case study per paper, most popular. This topic, over time, is applied equally in Asian, European, and North American case studies - so proportionally over represented in Europe and under represented in Asia.

-   Transport conferences, transport and health, applied urban planning journals are home to the majority of papers

-   Mainly focuses on urban areas, with only some papers including both urban/rural.

-   The majority of papers have a focus on transit mode. Next pedestrian (e.g., walkability), car, other, unspecified (e.g., network distance or some spatial distance proxy) , micro-mobility, and commuter rail.

Summary:

-   Not considering 'other', Income groups and age are the most common 'population characteristics' in these studies.

-   Not considering 'other, Healthcare, employment, then education facilities are the most popularly studied activities.

-   In these categories -\> 'other' is certainly worth unpacking further..

Keep in mind we categorized the papers. It is our interpretation of what the categories are and how to summarize it.

## Equity standards (and measures) and concepts (and dimensions)

Type of equity standard main category (std_mcat) vs. type of equity standard (std):

Summary:

-   Equity standards: the majority need to be unearth, they are 'other'. Those need to be further examine. As the bar chart makes clear - there's a lot of interesting 'other' types of measures used for 'other' standards.

-   Of the equity standards that are not 'other'. Max. travel time/distance are most popular, then perceived equity (qualitative methods typically), then some opportunity availability threshold, then cost/benefit. The type of measures they use are not surprising: max. travel time/distance mostly use accessibility indices - but travel distance is supplemented with surveys more often than studies using travel time.

-   All equity standard (not other) seem to use accessibility index the most - with exception to perceived equity. Unsurprisingly - they use surveys / focus groups / interviews.

-   Conceptualizations vs. dimensions; a lot to unpack there and certainly worth going over again to better synthesis.

# How equity dimensions, conceptualizations and standards are operationalized

## Broad measures of livability

Broad measures of livability and urban quality appear as goals for equity. They measures encompass *urban environment* equity thresholds which typically set minimum thresholds. [@agost-felipInclusiveModelAssessing2021], [@aldertonWhatMeaningUrban2019], [@adlakhaMindGapGender2020].....: These papers suggest equity thresholds informed by planning guidelines, interviews with local policy makers, or a combination of both. Measures of urban livability:

They also frequently approach these standards from broad equity conceptualizations and dimensions. [@agost-felipInclusiveModelAssessing2021] and [@aldertonWhatMeaningUrban2019] both conceptualization how urban environmental quality improves livability, and can have an impact on transport-related social exclusion along with wellbeing generally.

## Measures of population health - externalities

-   health burdens associated with low physical activity and low quality ped infrastructure, air pollution from high traffic roads. These papers generate health-informed standards that can be used for equity planning. Table:

\-\--

## Use of accessibility measures

Outputs or intermediate values used in accessibility measures such as opportunity accessibility thresholds, population thresholds, or travel cost thresholds are also the source of equity standards in some of the papers.

-   Many standards used for what an 'acceptable' travel distance to an opportunity. Standard justification varies -- from travel surveys, from planning standards, from literature, etc. They vary depending on destination, population, method, etc.
-   The studied activities, or destinations of interest also vary.
-   Many methods -- cumulative opportunities, Hansen-type, floating approaches, modified versions of those.
-   Use of travel standards to define travel threshold

## Prioritizing areas based on relative measures of equity

Many papers us relative comparisons to determine areas of inequity to determine priority. This can look like socio-demographic characteristics to determine what is an 'old age' and 'economically vulnerable' and ' non-civically engaged' population. (i.e., if average neighbourhood rates are 1.1 greater (or more) than population average).Various socio-demographic characteristics to determine what is an 'old age' and 'economically vulnerable' and ' non-civically engaged' population. (i.e., if average neighbourhood rates are 1.1 greater (or more) than population average) as done in [@agost-felipInclusiveModelAssessing2021].

[@abasoloEquityUtilizationAccess2001a] [@adliRightCityApplying2018] ... use relative measures as the goal. For instance, [@abasoloEquityUtilizationAccess2001a] defines horizontal and vertical equity (across socio-economic characteristics) in access and utilization of primary physicians as the goal. [@adliRightCityApplying2018] quantify the added accessibility to employment benefits from public transit investment, and a positive correlation coefficient associated with accessibility and prevailing socioeconomic outcomes as the equity goal.

## The definition of maximum or minimum standards

-   Energy requirement minimums
-   Air, noise, green space guidelines
-   Personal perspectives -- people who what's enough
-   Relatively equal, or relatively good -- what happens when void of a min or max?

## Disparity analysis and the intentional analysis of equity

The paper's motivation informs how they conceptualize equity, the dimensions of analysis, and how they choose to determine if a configuration is equitable or not. The **methods** used to define the equity standard widely varies.

Many papers that conceptualize equity as **horizontal** and/or **vertical** **equity** apply common equity measures such as Gini coefficient (horizontal), and Theil (vertical) and make it clear the achieving *equity* in these measures is the goal... Table?

Papers also implement **qualitative methods**, from surveys and questionnaires to interviews and focus-groups. The use of qualitative methods within this set of papers is often to establish *what is enough*. A minimum standard. For instance, [@albertsRebuildingWomenLivelihoods2016] undertake field work to interview women living on the city fringe in Semmencherry Chennai, India and identify their 'accessible space' through spatial analysis and qualitative livelihoods approach. They indeed find that the provision of sufficient, safe, and affordable public transport increases access to potential opportunities, however, access is not the complete picture; the choice to travel is balanced against the background of household composition. Further, the choice not travel is not always made because traveling is impossible.

# Discussion on how to move forward

How do we create equity standards and conceptualize equity?

## Guidelines from public health and surveys

-   WHO guidelines on noise, air pollution, physical activity. These can be transportation equity goals. They are well supported and discussed
-   Surveys: ask users what is sufficient, what is enough, what may be too much. These answers are context specific and are defined by how equity is conceptualized in the firth place.

## What's there: Some standards seem arbitrary, some conceptualizations are implicit

-   Not clear what destinations matter,
-   Not clear what type of measure to use, when. The conceptualization matters of course... but also the type of measure! Equity findings can be vastly different. Findings could be manipulated

## What's missing:

-   Relatively equal, or relatively good -- what happens when void of a min or max?
-   More equity intervention study. When we improve the network or land-use, how does equity change? This is lacking in the literature

## Many papers did not fit the mark (were excluded)

-   There is a gap between research and application. If no standard AND conceptualization -- how can planners and communities begin to apply? How to monitor our progress
-   Are Network Planning Guidelines Based on Equal Access Equitable? This study is interesting. No clear standard, but they challenge current guidelines and that is interesting, and novel.
-   Some interesting research has the potential to have interesting standards, but they don't provide some (for example, Price 2011)
